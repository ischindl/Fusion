/*
FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-30-00:10 (fleet — board surfaces):

THE BUG THIS CLOSES, and it is a real divergence rather than a rename.

`Column.tsx` and `ListView.tsx` answered every column-role question with

    workflowMode ? Boolean(columnFlags?.<trait>) : column === "<legacy id>"

`workflowMode` is `Boolean(boardWorkflows?.workflows.length)` — a BOARD-level boolean standing in for
a PER-COLUMN question. The two do not line up in one state, and it is a state that really occurs: the
board is in workflow mode, but THIS column has no resolved traits, because a mid-flight workflow edit
left a card in a column the workflow no longer declares.

There, the ternary took its first arm and evaluated an absent trait as false for every role. The
revert action, promote affordance, auto-merge toggle, Done-sort control, and bulk actions silently
disappeared, and nothing in the UI explained why.

The shared helpers ask per column: traits when resolved, the legacy id ONLY when the flags are truly
absent. That covers the pre-load window the old form handled with `workflowMode === false` AND the
undeclared-column case it got wrong.

This is a deliberate behaviour change and is pinned here so it stays deliberate.
