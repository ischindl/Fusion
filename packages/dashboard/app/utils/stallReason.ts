FNXC:StallReason 2026-09-01-17:48 (RUFU-175):
Before this module every dashboard surface (TaskCard, ListView, TaskDetailModal, the agent-health
pill) carried its OWN copy of "why is this card not moving". The card inferred it from a chain of
inline ternaries over task.paused / pausedReason / pausedByAgentId / status; the list carried a
different one; the detail modal carried a third. That meant:
  (a) a plain queued card surfaced a stall banner it should never have shown (queued is a normal
      resting state, not a stall),
  (b) an unexplained paused todo-column card showed a bare "paused" badge and nothing on its face
      naming WHY it was paused,
  (c) a dependency-blocked card named the blocking task only in a hover tooltip, never on the face,
  (d) a paused card in the detail view had no column-independent banner (the existing review banners
      are keyed to the review lane),
  (e) a paused-by-agent card with no reason string showed the bare word "paused".
This module is the single classifier for the question "why isn't this card moving?". It is a PURE,
browser-safe function: no engine import, no node builtin, no Date.now() (age flows through
elapsedSinceMs with the caller's dataAsOfMs so every surface agrees on "now"). Given a subject plus a
context (which carries the surface's `t`, so copy stays localized per-surface), it returns the first
stall that applies, or `undefined` when the card is flowing. Surfaces keep their own gating for WHICH
stalls they render and whether a dedicated affordance already covers a code — the resolver is the
authority for WHAT the reason is and its human-readable copy, not for the visibility decision.

Precedence (first match wins) is deliberately ordered by "most externally-forced / most operator-
actionable" so a card that is simultaneously, say, externally blocked AND paused reports the
external block (the thing that actually must be fixed) rather than the incidental pause the block
itself wrote:
  SERVER FIELD -> external-block -> duplicate-decision -> agent-paused -> user-paused -> engine-paused
  -> wedge -> dependency-block -> overlap-block -> merge-blocker -> completion-blocker
  -> agent-approval -> in-review-stall -> stalled-review -> stale-paused-review -> failed -> queued

The agent's approval wait sits after the card-specific blockers because it is an AGGREGATE per actor
(`getPendingCountsByActor`), not a fact about this card, and it renders no face affordance of its own —
ranked higher it would silence a real per-card reason. See the `agent-approval` branch for the full rule.

The chain below runs only when the server had nothing to say — see `serverStallReason`.

NOTE: an external block WRITES paused:true + pausedReason:"external-block" onto the task
(buildTaskExternalBlockPatch), so external-block MUST be evaluated before the paused family or the
card would misreport a freeze as a pause. That ordering is load-bearing, not stylistic.

  FNXC:StallReason 2026-09-01-19:15 (RUFU-175):
  Forward-compat seam for the server-derived blocker field RUFU-174 was specced to add
  (`task.stallReason: { code, reason, observedAt }`). RUFU-174 is NOT implemented on this branch
  (grep for `stallReason` across packages/core/src/types returns nothing; no derived field in
  task-store/reads.ts), so these stay plain optional reason STRINGS that no consumer wires today —
  they exist so the merge-blocker/completion-blocker codes are already in the precedence chain and
  the copy is already localized. When RUFU-174 lands its canonical code enum, a follow-up maps those
  server codes through this seam (and, per the interface-contract, lets a present `task.stallReason`
  win verbatim ahead of the client-side classifier) rather than minting a second parallel authority.
  Building that wiring here would be re-adding the dual-authority this feature exists to remove.

  FNXC:StallReason 2026-09-02-21:49 (RUFU-177): the promised follow-up has landed. RUFU-174 is on this
  lineage (`task.stallReason?: TaskStallReason`, hydrated in `packages/core/src/task-store/reads.ts`) and
  `serverStallReason` below is the mapping this note asked for, so the seam note above is now history.
  These two context fields are NOT the server channel and were not retired: `mergeBlockerReason` and
  `completionBlockerReason` remain the seam for a surface that resolves a blocker itself that the read
  path does not cover (a completion blocker computed in the detail view, for example), which is why they
  stay plain optional strings and still sit at their original position in the client chain — behind the
  server field, never in front of it.

FNXC:StallReason 2026-09-02-21:49 (RUFU-177):
RUFU-174's read path already answered "why is this card standing still?" by asking the real authorities
(`getTaskMergeBlocker` for the review lane, `allowsAutoMergeProcessing` for a human hold,
`getTaskCompletionBlocker` for live dependency edges) and shipping the verdict as `task.stallReason`. When
that field is present the SERVER'S answer is the classification — it outranks every client-side branch
below, which stays only as the fallback for reads that deliberately produced nothing (fresh-agent-log
suppression, a terminal lane, or a probe that failed open). Evaluating it first is also what keeps exactly
ONE affordance per cause: a review-lane card with an unresolved `blockedBy` would otherwise show a
dependency chip while the board's own authority says the merge is what refuses.

`code` identity is preserved verbatim (`dependency-blocker` is not rewritten to the client's
`dependency-block`) so the two authorities stay distinguishable even though they share a copy group.

Why the server's free-text `reason` never becomes rendered copy: it is the underlying authority's canonical
sentence — engine-authored English diagnostic data, not translator-owned prose — so a headline or badge
built from it would be untranslatable and would change wording every time the authority's text is reworded
(the type's own doc comment says `reason` "is display copy and may be reworded; consumers that branch must
branch on `code`"). Headline, badge and suggested action therefore always come from the mapped `stall.*`
catalog group. `reason` is carried as `description` only for the two merge-blocker codes, where it is the
sole text naming WHICH gate or check refuses; that is the same contract `external-block` and
`stalled-review` already use. Where localized copy can name the cause (dependency, human hold) the
localized copy wins and the server prose is dropped.

engine is executing them, which is the review loop working. The copy therefore never says "blocked" and
never points the operator at merge-retry tooling — the corrective action belongs to the next review round,
and an operator only acts if those remediation steps stop moving. The server's own fixed sentence is
catalog copy here rather than passed through (same rule as `held-human-review`: translator-owned prose is
not diagnostic data), and the badge label reuses the headline because the code is face-suppressed.

The seven planning-lane answers, each with its OWN copy group. A single shared "waiting to be planned"
sentence would have reproduced the defect this task exists to remove: before it, every aged silent
planning card looked identical, which is why "why hasn't this been planned?" could only be answered from
engine logs. The badge wording is deliberately short enough for a card chip, and no label pairs "plan"
with "failed" — a held plan is a hold, not a failure, and the copy must not send the operator to the
delivery lane for an answer about the planning lane.

Why `description` is localized prose rather than the server sentence (unlike `merge-blocker`, which passes
the blocker text through): a planning sentence is a fixed statement of policy, not a per-card diagnostic, so
rendering the engine's English text would make it untranslatable and would re-word itself every time that
authority is reworded. Every code reads its own `stall.<code>.*` group and none reads `server.reason`.

Single predicate for the generic face-visible stall chip shared by TaskCard, ListView (desktop rows and
mobile cards) and the detail banner, so every surface agrees on which codes get a visible reason
(previously hover-only or absent — symptoms b/c) and which keep only their dedicated affordance. Codes NOT
listed here are deliberately excluded because a richer affordance already speaks for them on those
surfaces: in-review-stall / stalled-review / stale-paused-review (dedicated review badges/lines), failed
(the card-error line), queued (the plain Queued badge), and duplicate-decision (the Needs-your-decision /
paused badge). A pause only earns the chip when it carries a reason word — a bare pause has nothing to add
beyond its badge.

FNXC:StallReason 2026-09-02-22:01 (RUFU-177):
Two changes, both forced by making `task.stallReason` the classifier's authority:

1. The external-block suppression moved IN HERE from TaskCard's call site. It used to be reachable only
   through the client chain (an external block classified itself as `external-block`, which is not listed
   below), so one surface's call-site guard was enough. Now the server field outranks that classification,
   so a card carrying BOTH an external block and a server answer would have rendered a second "blocked"
   affordance next to the `ExternalBlockNotice` — on ListView and the detail banner, which never had
   TaskCard's guard at all. Naming the cause once is this feature's whole contract, so the rule lives in
   the one arbiter and applies to all four surfaces; TaskCard's redundant call-site term is gone.

2. `merge-blocker` and `completion-blocker` become face-visible. They were the reported symptom: an
   in-review card whose merge genuinely refuses showed no reason anywhere.

FNXC:StallReason 2026-09-02-22:01 (RUFU-177) — the two detail-only codes:
`pre-merge-gate-pending` and `held-human-review` are true statements but they are the ORDINARY resting
states of a review lane (an enabled gate that has not run yet; auto-merge withheld for the card), and
under a project with automatic merge off they would put a chip on every card in review. The operator
already ruled on exactly this for the review-lane badge (see `FNXC:InReviewStallBadge 2026-07-26-18:12`,
"a pre-merge blocker is the ordinary in-review resting state, so badging it marked routine cards
abnormal"), so the card face keeps naming FAULTS (a real refusal, an unresolved edge, a hold, a pause
with a reason) and these two waits are named by the detail banner instead — the surface with room to
explain them, which is where the "no reason on any surface" symptom is actually cured for them. A surface
opts into them through `allowDetailOnlyCodes`; only the detail view does.
