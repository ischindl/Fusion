FNXC:StallReason 2026-09-01-17:48 (RUFU-175):
The detail view is the one surface that must answer "why isn't this card moving?" for a PAUSED card
independent of its column — every pre-existing banner there (failure alert, ExternalBlockNotice, the
review-lane stall banners) is keyed to a specific column or state, so a paused todo-column card showed
nothing. These tests pin the new generic stall banner: it names the reason for the codes the shared
face-visibility predicate assigns to the detail, and it stays silent wherever a dedicated affordance
already owns the code (failed -> failure alert, external-block -> notice, a flowing card -> nothing).

FNXC:PlanningAdmissionStall 2026-09-25-21:17 (RUFU-273):
The detail banner is where an aged planning card finally answers "why isn't this card being planned?".
Each of the seven planning codes must render ITS OWN copy group — headline, description, and a concrete
next step — and must keep the server's code verbatim, because seven codes collapsing into one sentence is
the exact symptom this feature removes. Unlike `merge-blocker`, a planning code's description row is the
catalog description, not the server's sentence: every planning code has complete localized copy, so
nothing untranslatable reaches the screen. `recoverable-work` is the one code whose subject is branch
work, so it is allowed branch wording while still never reading as a delivery failure. A landed card
shows none of them, matching the card and list surfaces.

The no-failure-language guard is scoped to the headline, not the whole banner: `plan-recovery-backoff`'s
description honestly reports that planning failed earlier, which is the reason for the scheduled retry —
naming that in prose is information, while headlining it would mislabel a wait as a fault.
