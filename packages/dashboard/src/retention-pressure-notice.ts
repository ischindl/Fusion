FNXC:RetentionPressureNotice 2026-09-23-18:55:
RUFU-257: the operator-facing half of the retention instrument. Between 2026-09-15 and 2026-09-17 the
dashboard OOM-crashed seven times while the heap climbed 1.5–2 GB/h, and the operator learned about it
only from a crash — `/metrics` had no in-process cache accounting at all, and nothing in the process
ever said "this is getting large". The census (`lib/retention-census.ts`) plus the retention sampler
(`metrics/retention-sampler.ts`) now attribute bytes per cache and decide when the pile-up is real
(`evaluatePressure`); this module is what that decision DOES, so the signal reaches a human before the
process dies rather than in a post-mortem.

CHANNEL — reuse, never invent. The pressure decision arrives as a `RetentionPressureSignal` from the
sampler tick. Two sinks, both pre-existing:
  1. the dashboard runtime log (`runtime-logger.ts`), so the pressure episode is in the same log stream
     an operator already tails;
  2. the operator mailbox, written through `MessageStore.sendMessageOnce` — the SAME one-shot system-notice
     seam `core/task-delete-notice.ts` and the wedge/approval notifications use. There is deliberately no
     new notification channel, no new SSE event type, and no dashboard-app rendering change here: the
     dashboard cannot import `@fusion/engine` (circularity rule), so the engine's `NotificationService` is
     reached only structurally through the message store the engine already exposes via
     `engine.getMessageStore()`.

RATE LIMITING is layered, because a stalled pile-up must never become a firehose:
  - the sampler's own `pressureCooldownMs` (default 10 min) gates how often ANY signal is emitted;
  - this module additionally makes the MAILBOX write idempotent per (reason, UTC bucket) — default one
    bucket per day — so a pressure episode that spans days re-announces itself daily and no louder, and a
    duplicate or concurrent write collapses in the DB's conflict handling exactly like the delete notice.

PAYLOAD HONESTY: the log context and message metadata carry the fixed reason enum, registered source ids,
and byte/ratio numbers only — never heap contents, cache keys, or request data. Prose exists only in the
mailbox `content` field (the delete-notice convention). The MessageStore itself sanitizes control
characters on write; nothing here writes to run-audit (FN-7158/FN-9175 reserve audit rows for
ids/counts/outcomes, and census numbers are explicitly excluded from it).

BEST-EFFORT: memory telemetry must never become a lifecycle dependency. `notifyRetentionPressure` never
throws and never rejects, and the notifier wrapper fires it without awaiting, so a missing, throwing, or
slow mailbox cannot stall or fail the census tick that was trying to report the problem.
