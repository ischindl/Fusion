/**
 * RUFU-377 Step 3: an agent called `fn_agent_show` and received
 * `fn_agent_show failed: fn extension TaskStore boot timed out after 30000ms`.
 *
 * The Step-2 discriminator (`task-store-boot-concurrency.test.ts`) only proves which budget
 * expired when the caller goes to the store resolver directly. This file closes the two claims
 * that live one layer out, at the agent-class surface itself:
 *
 * 1. **The registered tool is the one that pays the budget.** `kbExtension` intercepts
 *    `pi.registerTool` and re-wraps every execute, so the deadline text can only reach an agent
 *    through `wrapExtensionToolExecute`. Asserting that on a hand-written wrapper would be a
 *    tautology, so the PostgreSQL-gated section below registers the real extension and drives the
 *    tools it actually registered — `fn_agent_show` / `fn_list_agents` / `fn_agent_org_chart`,
 *    representatives of the agent-class read family that share one `getAgentStore` → `getStore`
 *    resolution.
 * 2. **A tool-layer rejection keeps its attribution.** A cold-cache boot failure must surface
 *    *inside* the `${toolName} failed: ` prefix — the wrapper's job is to propagate the store-boot
 *    reason, not to relabel it as an agent-tool fault.
 *
 * Premise correction against the spec, re-verified on HEAD: `fn_agent_show` is NOT behind the
 * agent permission-policy gate — `applyAgentPolicyGateForExtensionTool` has 9 call sites on HEAD
 * (`fn_task_pause` / `fn_task_unpause` / `fn_task_retry` / `fn_agent_stop` / `fn_agent_start` /
 * `fn_agent_set_instructions` / `fn_workflow_update` / `fn_workflow_delete` / `fn_delegate_task`).
 * RUFU-275's `taskstore-boot-unavailable` deny cause therefore CANNOT be the shape this card saw;
 * only the tool-wrapper prefix `${toolName} failed: ` can, which is exactly the discriminator this
 * file pins.
 *
 * FNXC:TaskStoreBootDeadline 2026-09-28-05:20: No 30 000 ms of wall clock is burned here. The
 * deadline class is proven by arming the shared backoff through the registry seam with a tiny
 * budget and asserting the agent-class surface reads it at once, plus a fast-rejecting factory for
 * the propagated-failure shape. A hung factory a regressed tool actually awaited would park the
 * lane for the full real budget, so the registered-tool arm resolves its spy factory in 5 ms and
 * lets the zero-invocation counter carry the assertion.

FNXC:CliTests 2026-09-28-09:12 (RUFU-388):
This file used to drive every arm from a hard-coded absolute path to one developer's checkout. The
extension resolves the canonical project root before it consults the store registry, so that constant
only ever passed on the machine it named: on any other host `resolveProjectRoot` walks past a directory
carrying no `.fusion` marker, the key the tools look up stops matching the key the arms seed, and the
twelve registry arms below break on a perfectly healthy product.

The fixture is a fresh temp directory per run instead, and the `.fusion` marker inside it is load-bearing
rather than decorative: `resolveProjectRoot` returns the FIRST ancestor carrying that marker, and this
host demonstrably has a `.fusion` directory at the temp root itself — measured during this card, an
unmarked fixture resolved to `/tmp`, not to the fixture. So the marker is what pins resolution to the
fixture on every host, and the `BOOT-REGISTRY-PARITY` case in the first describe is what turns that
derivation from an assumption into an asserted invariant (it goes red, loudly, if an ancestor ever
intercepts the walk). The `afterAll` below removes the directory.

(packages/engine/src/runtimes/child-process-runtime.ts). The JSDoc above `reportStoreBoot` nonetheless
promised a durable engine-side record, which is the false contract that cost that search its entire
attempt. The architecture doc already states the opposite invariant ("process-local console output, not
telemetry"). These are code-construct scans, not prose checks: the emission seam must stay exactly one
