FNXC:ConfirmedMergeFinalization 2026-08-23-07:42:
FN-180 requires a confirmed integration merge to finalize even when a concurrent
review bounce left a stale checklist. Post-merge checks deliberately exclude
steps and review verdicts; only independent task blocking states may defer.

FNXC:ConfirmedMergeFinalization 2026-08-28-11:05:
A failed status cannot block post-merge finalization because all consumers establish durable merge
or landing proof before calling this helper: the shared finalizer uses hasDurableMergeProof, the
project-engine fast path verifies mergeConfirmed reachability, and self-healing proves the landed
commit. getTaskHardMergeBlocker already neutralizes failed for the same FN-9193 failure shape. This
is not a laundering path: keeping proven-landed work out of completion cannot un-merge it and only
leaves a permanently failed board card; every independent operator and planning status still blocks.

than the two independent loops the fork had: the blocker can no longer disagree with the recovery route.
Their classification is kept verbatim — an absent row is resumable, while duplicate / pending / failed /
skipped / non-approved rows all block, because each names a durable result the graph already produced.
What is layered on top is the requirement side: which gates are required, and which of them this board can
report at all, comes from `getPostMergeEvidenceGateStatuses` (delivery shape RUFU-429, evidence reporter
RUFU-430). A gate whose requirement is `not-applicable` is neither resumable nor blocking; reading raw rows
for it would resurrect the waiver-per-landing defect on every board that has no CI reporter.
