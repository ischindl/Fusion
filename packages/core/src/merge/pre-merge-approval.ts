authority: an authored non-approving verdict (`REVISE`/`RETHINK`/`UNAVAILABLE`) keeps the row out of
this class and stays in the remediation-only lane (AC2). `status === "failed"` excludes `pending`
rows (in-flight sessions own them; FN-8492 rewrites orphaned pending to `failed`, at which point the
row joins this class), `advisory_failure` rows (a distinct terminal status with its own advisory-lane
semantics, not the failed-gate shape), and `skipped`+bypassed waiver rows;
`arbitrationDecision === undefined` excludes adjudicated rows.

failing on an exit code never owed a verdict, belongs to the ordinary failed-step remediation lane,

RUFU-172/178 classified a verdict-less remediation carrier as `missing` so FN-9243's re-seed would run
the gate again, replacing the unsatisfiable `not-approved` refusal that stranded FN-9243 cards.

FNXC:PreMergeApproval 2026-09-06 (merge origin/main dd808ed2c6, FN-295):
Upstream FN-295 shipped a different recovery for the same wedge and the classifier now defers to it.
An archived carrier stays `not-approved`; recovery is (a) `auditedOperatorWaiver` — an audited FN-7720
bypass satisfies the gate in place, and (b) `resolveCollateralArchivedReviewGate` — self-healing
restores a carrier that was archived as COLLATERAL of another gate's remediation back to its
recoverable `failed` state. `getLatestFailedPreMergeReviewStep` selects the carrier for the operator
bypass directly. RUFU-178's `isReRunnableRemediationCarrier` → `missing` branch is therefore DELETED:
keeping it would pre-empt the `not-approved` answer upstream's tests and diagnostics reason about.

FN-295: `archiveTerminalWorkflowStepFailures` archives EVERY terminal failure on the card, not only the
gate whose remediation is running. A Plan Review row that a restart had left `pending` — rewritten to
`failed` by the FN-8492 orphaned-step sweep, never by a reviewer — was therefore archived as collateral
of a Code Review remediation. The archived carrier is then a permanent merge veto (`remediationArchivedAt`
is unconditional below) that NO recovery owns: the reseed handles only `missing`, the stale-content
reroute only `stale-content`, and the FN-7720 operator bypass selects only `status:"failed"`. Measured on
FN-295: three review restarts each re-ran Code Review and Documentation successfully and still merged
nothing, because the poisoned row is in neither of those lanes.

This resolver restores such a collateral carrier to the terminal failure it actually was, so the card is
recoverable again through the ordinary audited bypass. It deliberately does NOT approve anything: no
verdict is written, and a row carrying a real operator waiver (`bypassedBy`) or belonging to the gate that
owns the remediation wave is never touched.
