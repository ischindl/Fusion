FNXC:ZeroCommitLandingProof 2026-09-25-11:17 (RUFU-274):
A card whose branch has zero commits ahead of the integration branch can still be carrying the only
copy of its work: uncommitted files in the worktree. Git cannot see them. `rev-list --count` returns 0
and branch ancestry returns "contained in main" for a branch whose content was NEVER committed, so
every lane that reasons about "already landed / nothing to merge" from revision-walk evidence alone
will finalize such a card, let worktree cleanup delete the tree, and report it `done`.

RUFU-262 is the observed symptom: zero commits ahead, a worktree that still held modified and
untracked files, and the card standing in the complete lane. FN-8141 was the same laundering shape
with a clean tree (a reverted task finalized as a no-op), which is why this predicate covers the
zero-commit finalize generally instead of only the reported dirty case.

The invariant this module encodes: **landing proof is proof of delivered CONTENT, not proof of
git ancestry.** Ancestry is necessary and not sufficient — the missing half is a classification of
what is sitting in the worktree.

Why this lives in `@fusion/core` as a pure function: `packages/engine/src/merge/merger.ts` is ~11.6k
lines, `self-healing.ts` ~19.1k, `merger-ai.ts` ~4.1k and `project-engine.ts` ~7k. A predicate
re-implemented at that many sites drifts, which is why `assertCleanForDefensiveRemoval` today has
seven production call sites that pass inconsistent options — one passes none, one swallows the throw
with a bare catch, one passes an explicit ceiling. One predicate, one row sentence, one audit
vocabulary; the lanes differ only in how they deliver the verdict (Steps 2-5).

The lane's own `mergeConfirmed` flag and its own no-op claim are deliberately NOT inputs: they are the
claim under test. A lane that could approve itself by setting the flag it is being guarded on is how
the empty-merge lane produced RUFU-262 in the first place (`noOpResult()` writes
`mergeConfirmed: true`, and the merge-confirmed fast path in `project-engine.ts` then finalizes any
row carrying it).

These are the states in which NO uncommitted content of this card can survive to be lost. `absent` belongs
here even though it is an inference rather than a status read, because the classifier only reaches it after
the recorded path is gone AND `git worktree list` was read successfully and named no other checkout holding
the branch — so there is nowhere the files could be. A failed read of that registry is `unverifiable`, and
`deliverable`/`unverifiable` are the two states this predicate refuses; a tree that exists but holds only
committed-or-ignored content is `clean`/`regenerable-ignored`. RUFU-262's own row was `deliverable` (path
present, 9 modified + 4 untracked), so this arm never authorizes the incident shape.

`absent` stays SEPARATE from `clean` in the vocabulary because the two answer different questions: Step 5's
pointer rule may clear a genuinely-gone path from the row but the delivery CLAIM still needs its own proof
(`getMergeConfirmedFinalizationBlocker`, `hasDurableLandingProof`). Nothing may be at risk is not the same
statement as the work was delivered, and only the second one licenses `done`.

The workspace partial-land sweep (`reconcileWorkspacePartialLands`) parks a card `failed` when a member
repository is PROVEN branch-gone with no `landedSha` (FORK-A), or when its branch state could not be read
after the bounded starvation budget. That judgement is sound for a card that owes commits and proves it
wrong for a card whose own plan declares `noCommitsExpected` — for that contract, git has nothing to show
by design, so "no branch, no landedSha" is the EXPECTED delivery shape rather than lost work.

Measured live on SANE-509: `no_commits_expected = 1`, both member branches present at zero unique
commits, review re-executed green, and the sweep parked the card `failed` with the FORK-A sentence every
pass. Because `getTaskMergeBlocker` treats any blocking status as a merge blocker, that single write also
refused the operator's `in-review → done` drag (`409 code=merge-blocked`), the stall classifier
(`stall:merge-blocker`), and every recovery door that consults the same authority — so a missing push
blocked the card from every direction at once, with no lane owning the repair.

The two sentence prefixes below are the SHARED FACT between the writer and the reader: the sweep builds
its park error from them and this module recognises them, so a wording change cannot silently orphan the
recognition the way a duplicated literal would. Recognition stays deliberately narrow — it names only
these two sentences, written only by that sweep, on a card that carries the explicit zero-commit
authorization. It is not a general "ignore failures on no-commits cards" rule, and it waives nothing
