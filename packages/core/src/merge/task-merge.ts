FN-408's execution-entry fence is `isTaskBlockedOnHumanPlanApproval`, which lives in

1. Semantics: `isTaskBlockedOnApproval` above also guards PLANNING continuation dispatch

   the reviewer from ever producing the plan the operator is supposed to validate, so the card could
   never become decidable. The two predicates must stay separate.
2. Bundling: this module's exports are consumed by the dashboard's browser bundle, while
   `planner/human-plan-approval.ts` transitively imports `planner/plan-approval.ts` and its
   top-level `node:crypto`. Importing it here pulls `node:crypto` into the browser graph and breaks
   the dashboard build — measured on 2026-09-15. The browser mirror in

FNXC:MergeConfirmedFinalization 2026-08-23-21:40 (FN-9193 aftermath — the wedge that outlived the race):
A CARD WHOSE BRANCH IS ALREADY ON THE TARGET MUST ALWAYS BE ABLE TO FINALIZE. FN-9193 landed
eaa1d47c on main and was then left `mergeConfirmed: true` WITH incomplete steps, because a Code
Review revision request reset its steps while the approved merge was in flight. Every finalization
site evaluated `getTaskHardMergeBlocker`, which counts incomplete steps, so the card could never
reach `done` — it sat `failed` re-reading its own contradiction for five hours, and a RESTART made it
strictly worse: replanning issued seven fresh `pending` steps, so the retry that was supposed to
rescue the card re-created the exact condition blocking it. A self-defeating loop with no exit.

Incomplete steps are not a safety property here. Holding the card out of `done` does not un-merge
anything; the code is live on the target branch either way. The only thing the hold buys is an
inconsistent board and an alarming failed card. Landing proof is established BEFORE this check by
the callers' `hasDurableMergeProof` / reachability verification, so this is not a laundering path:
`mergeConfirmed` alone never reaches here.

What still blocks: a failed or pending PRE-MERGE workflow step (a review that actually rejected this
content is a real signal even post-landing, and the operator-bypass path exists for it). What no
longer blocks: incomplete `steps`, which describe implementation work that the landed branch has
already superseded. Callers must surface the unfinished steps rather than silently dropping them.
