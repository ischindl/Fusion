/*
FNXC:TaskLogProjections 2026-10-10-19:13 (RUFU-615):
The equivalence proof this task exists to produce.

`tasks.log` is 31.4 MB of the live board's 73.6 MB of live-row bytes, and it could not simply be
dropped from the list projection because five read-time derivations consume it. This file is the
evidence that dropping it changes NOTHING:

  1. CROSS-IMPLEMENTATION — `project.fusion_task_log_projections()` (the migration's one-time
     backfill) and `deriveTaskLogProjections()` (the steady-state write seam) agree value-for-value
     over crafted logs, including the malformed shapes the live table actually contains.
  2. READ PATH — every observable the five derivations produce (`timedExecutionMs`, `stalledReview`,
     the reason-driven-stall veto, `inReviewStalled`'s last-activity time, the identical-stall run
     count) is DEEP-EQUAL between a row read with `log` and the same row read with
     `excludeLog: true`.
  3. EFFECT — the `log` column is genuinely absent from the rows a log-free read returns, and
     `log_recent` stays TOAST-inline.
  4. PAIRING — no log-writing seam leaves the derived columns behind.
  5. BACKFILL — the SQL backfill reaches the same values the write seam would have written.

A green suite here is not acceptance on its own: the byte-and-wall-time numbers live in the task
document `bench`, and `pg_column_size` is measured below precisely so "we stopped transferring the
column" is a fact rather than an intention.
