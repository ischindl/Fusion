FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-30-15:20 (found by a #2739 review thread):
THE ROLE-ROUTING POLICY WAS BYPASSED ENTIRELY ON A RENAMED BOARD.

`isImplementationTask` is a Set membership test over these hardcoded ids, and
`evaluateImplementationTaskBind` short-circuits to `{ allowed: true }` when it returns false. So on a
workflow whose lanes are named anything else, EVERY agent was bind-compatible with EVERY task: the role
check that exists to stop a liaison/custom agent being handed implementation work — the NEXT-871 loop
FN-7851 fixed — silently did not apply.

HOW IT SURFACED, which is the part worth keeping: a reviewer noticed my dispatch test claimed to exercise
the bind evaluator while omitting the optional `agent` argument. Passing a real agent was not enough to
prove the evaluator RAN, so I added a case asserting a `custom`-role agent is refused an implementation
task on a renamed lane. It FAILED — the task was handed over — and the cause is this Set, not the test.

WHY THE CENSUS NEVER FLAGGED IT: these are Set MEMBERS, not comparisons. The lifecycle-column census scans
`===`/`!==` against a column, so a literal collection is invisible to it — the same blind spot that hid the
raw-`sql` encoding of the archived gate (PR #2724). Worth knowing that the backlog number is a floor, not a
total.

FNXC:LaneCapabilityVocabulary 2026-09-26-18:46 (RUFU-272 — RESOLVED, the sync-purity constraint lifted
without making the predicate async):
This stayed FLAGGED because resolving a workflow inside the predicate meant threading a resolver through
the routing policy. The resolution instead makes the resolved set an OPTIONAL parameter of every policy
surface: callers that HOLD the task's resolved IR (the dispatch selector via
`resolveTaskImplementationColumns`, the heartbeat wake gate) pass `implementationColumns` and get the
board's real lane vocabulary — a UNION with this legacy set, never a replacement, so a v1-upgraded
trait-less IR and every failure path classify exactly as before; callers that pass nothing keep the
legacy-only classification byte-for-byte. The hole closes where a caller can resolve; nothing gets
async, and no admission path silently widens.

GitHub issue Runfusion/Fusion#2015: product-code executor tasks were repeatedly routed to a liaison-only agent because
every routing path (scheduler auto-assign pool, heartbeat auto-claim, delegation, claim primitive) gated only on the
coarse `role` field — an agent whose mandate is "file upstream bug reports, never implement product code" is
indistinguishable from a real executor when its role is "executor".
The per-agent assignment policy (agent.runtimeConfig.assignmentPolicy) closes this:
- "auto" (default): current behavior — eligible for auto-assignment, backlog auto-claim, and explicit routing.
- "explicit-only": never auto-assigned or auto-claimed; may still receive explicitly routed/delegated tasks.
- "none": may NEVER be bound to implementation tasks by any path — including explicit delegation and the
  sourceMetadata.executorRoleOverride bypass. This is the hard guarantee for liaison/observer-type agents.

`runtimeConfig.enabled` means ONE thing: run this agent's own durable heartbeat loop. Every consumer in the
engine reads it that way — heartbeat scheduling, error recovery, self-healing, the in-process runtime — except
the workflow router, which also treated it as "may own a workflow stage". Those are different questions, and
conflating them is what produced BOTH failures here:

 - Built-in owners ship with the heartbeat off (correct — they are invoked BY the workflow engine and must not
   run autonomous loops or auto-claim work), and that silently made every built-in role unroutable, deadlocking
   the board.
 - Turning the heartbeat on to restore routing then gave four agents autonomous loops nobody asked for.

So the flag is separated: `enabled` governs the heartbeat runtime ONLY, and workflow routability is answered by
{@link isWorkflowPrincipalEligible}. For the four built-in owners routability is STRUCTURAL — they are the
engine's own principals for triage/executor/reviewer/merger, there is no fallback if a role cannot route, and
"unroutable" is not a state an operator can meaningfully select. To take one out of rotation, add your own
agent with that role and route to it; that leaves the role routable, which is the property this protects.

STRUCTURAL capability for a workflow stage, kept separate from AVAILABILITY. The distinction decides
whether an unroutable named principal is a WAIT or a DEAD END, and conflating the two wedged the board:

FN-8869/FN-8928/FN-8845 were each explicitly assigned to a permanent ENGINEER-role agent, which
`canAgentTakeImplementationTaskForExplicitRouting` allows by design. The workflow `step-execute` node then
took that owner as `task-assignee` named authority, found no `executor` tag, and held closed — and a NAMED
principal never falls through to the role pool. Two idle `Workflow Executor` pool agents sat unused while the
cards re-dispatched and re-held every ~15 minutes for hours. The only thing still touching them was the owner
agent's own hourly heartbeat, which logged "progressing, no blockers" and exited: heartbeat observation had
silently replaced execution.

An agent that lacks the role can NEVER satisfy the node, so waiting on it is unbounded by construction. It was
never authority for this node in the first place — routing must skip it and continue precedence. Only an agent
that HAS the role but is momentarily unusable (paused/errored/disabled runtime/at session capacity) earns a
hold, because that hold ends on its own.
