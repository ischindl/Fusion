FNXC:TaskStallReason 2026-09-01-15:35 (RUFU-174):
Per-row wiring for the canonical stall/hold reason, shared by ALL FOUR hydration sites so the
same card cannot answer differently on the board, in detail, on the incremental stream, or in
search. The sites already own the inputs the derivation needs (per-pass IR cache, resolved
review lanes, settings, merge-queue set); this wrapper adds only the two things the sites do
not have: the resolved required-gate ids and a dependency-reference resolver.

The resolver is deliberately LOCK-FREE. `store.getTask` takes the target's per-task advisory
lock — reachable from `getTaskImpl`, which already holds THIS task's lock, so a lock-order
inversion between two mutually-referencing cards could deadlock the two reads. The engine's
completion wrapper tolerates that because it runs outside any task lock; a read-path twin does
not. So references resolve through plain indexed reads: `readTaskRow` (live row), then
`getArchivedTask` (cold-storage snapshot, whose `column` is the literal `"archived"`), then
null. Cost contract: rows covered by the caller's own pass answer from `localColumnByTaskId`
with zero reads (a board feed usually carries blockers and blocked cards together); only a
reference outside the pass pays one indexed read; and because `deriveTaskStallReason` invokes
the resolver ONLY from the dependency branch, cards that are suppressed, terminal, or judged
in the review lane never trigger one.

Satisfaction lanes are populated INSIDE the resolver, keyed by the dependency's own id, before
it returns: `getTaskCompletionBlocker` awaits `resolveTask` immediately before each satisfaction
check, so an entry written during resolution is always visible to the check for that id — the
same lazy substitution the engine performs with a prefetch. An unresolvable workflow leaves the
dep un-mapped, which keeps the documented legacy literals.

  FNXC:ListTasksExcludeLog 2026-09-09-01:48 (RUFU-202):
  Drops the `log` jsonb column from the SQL projection for a consumer that provably never reads it.
  On the live RunFusion board `log` is the single heaviest column (~11 KB/row) and the hold-release
  sweep fetched it once per scheduler pass without ever reading it, so the projection was paying
  ~14 MB per pass for a column nothing consumed.

  Only effective alongside `derive: false`. With derivation on, `log` is a derivation INPUT —
  `stalledReview` and `timedExecutionMs` are computed from log entries before any wire stripping —
  so dropping it would silently disable two board badges (FNXC:TaskStoreReads 2026-07-05-15:30).
  Passing `excludeLog` with derivation on is therefore a documented no-op, not a badge regression.

  This is deliberately NOT `slim: true`. `slim` bundles three unrelated contracts, and the one that
  matters here is `finalizeSlimListTask`: it re-parses PROMPT.md for EVERY task whose persisted
  `steps` is empty. `parseStepsFromPromptImpl` is not memoised (one `existsSync` + one `readFile`
  per such task per call), so `slim` trades a 14 MB column fetch for unbounded per-pass file I/O
  whose size is only knowable from a live census. A board sweep that never reads `steps` has no
  business paying it. `excludeLog` buys the column saving with zero file reads and zero other field
  drops, so the release-decision fields (`prompt`, `description`, `paused*`, `workflowStepResults`)
  stay byte-identical to the non-slim row. `slim` also blanks `prInfo`/`review`/`attachments` and
  re-syncs `steps`, any of which could change a release decision on an unrelated future call site.

  The startup memo needs no key extension: it is gated on `slim`, so a non-slim `excludeLog` read
  can never enter it, and for slim-eligible shapes the effective decision depends only on `derive`,
  which is already a key component.
