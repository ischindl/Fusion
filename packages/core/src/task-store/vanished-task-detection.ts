RUFU-225 proved that a task can be alive on disk and dead on every board read at the same time, and
that the board stays silent about it. Its mirror at `.fusion/tasks/RUFU-225/task.json` still carried
an APPROVE_WITH_NOTES code-review verdict, an `in-review` column and an `updatedAt` of
2026-09-17T14:08Z, while `fusion/rufu-225` held 3 commits that exist on no other ref. Nothing
surfaced it: `detectTaskIdIntegrityAnomalies` is row-only (active/archived duplicates, collisions,
sequence gaps) and reported `status: "ok"` throughout, a board query cannot return a row that is not
there, and FN-6783's orphan re-import needs BOTH a fully absent row and a 7-day age window the
mirror never reached. The operator found the card by hand.

This module is the inverse read: the disk directory is the authority for what work EXISTED, and the
row plus the branch are consulted to explain what happened to it. The classifier is pure — the
caller supplies the disk mirror, the row-presence branch (`TaskStore.resolveTaskIdPresence`) and the
branch probe (`git rev-list --count <branch> --not <base>`) — so the taxonomy is unit-testable
without a database or a checkout, and the engine sweep stays thin glue.

"An authored verdict already exists" is a stronger claim than "the step passed": it survives the
session that produced it, and it is exactly the evidence that turns a vanished directory into work
worth salvaging urgently rather than a housekeeping note. `requiresAuthoredReviewVerdict` is the
shared authority for that predicate — reusing it keeps this detector from drifting from the merge
gate it is describing (it also refuses an authored approval sitting on a step that never required
one). `remediationArchivedAt` is FN-295's veto: a row archived by a later remediation had its
verdict superseded, so it cannot claim salvage priority.

The hint exists because "row missing, branch unmerged" still leaves the operator to work out whether
this is salvage worth chasing. An approved gate plus unmerged commits means the review already
happened and only delivery was lost, so the hint says salvage-or-resurrect rather than re-plan; a
lost branch moves recovery to the disk mirror and names the remaining clock (the reflog).
