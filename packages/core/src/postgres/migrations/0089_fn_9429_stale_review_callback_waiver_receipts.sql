-- FNXC:MigrationVersionCollision 2026-10-01-15:26: upstream released this as 0086, the slot this line had already given its STAS-205 review-lane ledger. Two migrations cannot share one `fusion_schema_migrations.version`: the ledger moved to 0088 and this file is re-issued at 0089. The DDL is idempotent, so a database that ever recorded upstream's 0086 re-applies it harmlessly here.
-- FN-9429: authoritative receipt for automatic stale code-review callback waivers.
