  FNXC:ApprovalHoldMoveClear 2026-09-25-11:12 (RUFU-297 defect A):
  `task:move-cleared-approval-hold` is emitted post-commit by `moveTaskInternal` when a user-driven
  move out of a review lane clears an approval hold whose evidence the reopen hooks just destroyed
  (or the gated-session pause shape that move supersedes). Metadata: { priorStatus, awaitingApprovalReason
  (the reason-code enum, or "none" for the bare marker), fromColumn, toColumn, moveSource, outcome:
  "cleared" } — status, a fixed code, columns, and a fixed outcome; never hold prose or error text. The row is
  the audit proof of the hold/evidence pair invariant at the move seam; its ABSENCE next to a
  step-wiping review exit is what distinguishes defect A from a legitimate hold-preserving move
  (plan-approval release, graph remediation, preserveStatus, userPaused).

  /*
  FNXC:VanishedTaskDetection 2026-09-24-00:40 (RUFU-283):
  `task:vanished-approved-work` is emitted once per operator-visible finding by the
  `reconcile-vanished-task-dirs` sweep. Metadata: { taskId, reason, branchRef, unmergedCommitCount,
  gateApproved, salvageTarget } — ids, a fixed reason enum, counts and one derived ref; never mirror
  content, prompt text, log prose or error text.

  The literal names the class the operator must never lose silently (approved work with an unmerged
  branch), which is why it stays even though the sweep also reports the neighbouring classes: `reason`
  carries the taxonomy (`row-missing|row-tombstoned` × `branch-unmerged|branch-missing`, plus
  `state-unresolved` when the branch could not be probed) and `gateApproved` says whether a gate
  actually approved the card. Do not read a row with `gateApproved: false` as a false positive — it is
  the same disappearance, just not yet an approved one.

  `task:row-purged-for-resurrection` is the mandatory pre-write for a tombstone hard-delete on the
  resurrection path, so a purged id is always attributable. Metadata: { taskId, operation,
  allowResurrection, forceResurrect, deletedAtPresent, purgedWorkflowStepCount }. Both are written
  transactionally with the mutation they describe, which is what makes the purge fail closed.

  /*
  FNXC:PlanningAdmissionStall 2026-09-25-19:31 (RUFU-273 Step 3):
  The planning-admission stall pair, one row per outcome of a `reconcile-planning-admission-stall` pass.
  `stalled` NOMINATES a card (its row now carries an episode code); `stalled-no-action` is a candidate the
  pass examined and deliberately left alone, with `outcome` naming why (`premise-held`,
  `recovery-backoff`, `triage-owned`, `already-named`). Without the second row "the sweep ran and had
  nothing to say" is indistinguishable from "the sweep never ran" — the same ambiguity RUFU-297 removed
  for approval holds. Metadata is ids/counts/fixed codes only: `taskId`, `column`, `code`, `ageMs`,
  `staleBranchCommitCount`, `outcome`, `scannedCount`. The branch is represented by its COMMIT COUNT,
  never a tip sha, and no spec text or blocker prose enters either row.

  /*
  FNXC:CommentDelivery 2026-09-27-17:36 (RUFU-259):
  `task:comment-delivery` records one comment's routing attempt and `task:comment-delivery-unowned` the
  one case where no agent could be resolved at all. Before these rows existed a comment could be dropped
  (an `on-heartbeat` recipient skipped by the wake path, or a card nobody owns) while the write surface
  still answered 200, so nothing in the system distinguished "steering landed" from "steering
  evaporated". Metadata is ids/counts/fixed enums only (`source`, `kind`, `commentId`, `via`, `outcome`,
  `unroutedReason`, `skippedRungs`, `poolSize`, `messageStoreAvailable`, optional
  `messageId`/`noticeDelivered`); the comment body is operator prose and is never recorded.
