A file-scope contention wait must remain durable after the transient `task.overlapBlockedBy`
display marker clears (Reset, blocker completion, another producer overwriting it). Each
observed predecessor edge is persisted as its own episode so a re-validated resume can prove
which specific predecessor's delivery it already accounted for, independent of whatever the
marker currently says. See docs/storage.md "Overlap wait synchronization episodes".

  FN-429. A delivery rewritten by an integration-branch rebase keeps its patch and Fusion trailers while
  changing SHA, so freshness cannot be proven from `landedSha` alone. `reconciledSha` records the SHA that
  was proven equivalent and `reconciliationProof` the cumulative evidence that admitted it, both stored in
  the existing receipt JSON (no migration). Persisting them is what lets Retry, an engine restart, or a
  deleted worktree resume without re-deriving the proof — and `landedSha` is preserved, never rewritten.

  FNXC:MergeRebuild0919 2026-09-19-21:45:
  Canonical's compact line never carried FN-429, so its `OverlapWaitDeliveryProof` has neither field.
  This line does: `packages/engine/src/executor/overlap-resume-gate.ts` writes and re-reads them, so they
  stay. Union, not a vintage choice — the canonical `revalidate` decision/phase below and these two fields
  are independent additions to the same receipt JSON.
