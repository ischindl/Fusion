    RUFU-246 — operator Retry is the sanctioned un-park for a card terminally parked on an exhausted
    plan-premise contract, and it lifts the park by clearing the refusal episode. The clear is
    KEY-level (`planPremiseRejection: null` via sourceMetadataPatch), so unrelated sourceMetadata
    provenance keys (duplicate-of, handoff-from) survive a Retry untouched. Without this clear the
    episode's sticky-park signature would re-park the card on its very next release attempt, making
    the Retry a no-op. Every Retry surface (dashboard route branches, column-stage restart) spreads
    this builder, so the lift lives in exactly one place.

    would keep the chip asserting a gate the operator has just overruled — the card would re-show
    "waiting for a planner slot" after the run had already been restarted. Cleared in the same patch
    so both episodes lift together and unrelated provenance keys still survive.
