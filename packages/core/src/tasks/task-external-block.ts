FNXC:ExternalBlock 2026-09-13-06:25:
A proven-repeating dependency-init failure against an unchanged worktree is operator-recoverable
project configuration state. It deliberately bypasses narrow message-sniffing classification because
its durable engine evidence, not diagnostic prose, authorizes the freeze.

FNXC:ExternalBlock 2026-08-28-03:48:
An obstacle outside the worktree freezes the task at its exact durable resume point. The patch must
retain column, steps, current step, worktree, and branch, and must not write userPaused because an
external block is operator-recoverable lifecycle state rather than an operator-authored pause.
