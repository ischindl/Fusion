The lease classifier needs to distinguish "this card retained a checkout" from "this card retains a
checkout that still has something to preserve". Path presence alone was never proof of unmerged work:
a task branch cut from the base that never committed anything is byte-identical to the base, so the
checkout it retains protects nothing while it serializes every overlapping peer forever (RUFU-198
deadlocked RUFU-199 exactly this way while sitting `todo` and dependency-blocked, and no dispatch-time
recovery could ever reach it).
The verdict is computed OUTSIDE core (git I/O) and arrives as a downgrade-only input. `empty` means
clean worktree AND zero commits ahead of the resolved base, per repository. `occupied` is positive
evidence of work to preserve. `unknown` means the proof could not be obtained — a failed or timed-out
git call, an unresolvable base ref, a missing map entry — and MUST behave exactly like `occupied`,
because the failure mode of guessing wrong is destroying someone's uncommitted work. Absent the whole
argument the predicate is byte-for-byte its pre-RUFU-200 self, which is what keeps every legacy
caller and fixture on today's behavior.

recognize their per-repository checkouts. A retained entry is the unfinished-work proof; executor and archive
cleanup delete those entries when the checkout is removed, preserving checkout clearing as the early-release hatch.

FNXC:OverlapScheduling 2026-09-11-22:49:
A canonical package barrel export file (`packages/<pkg>/src/index.ts` and its trimmed gate sibling
`index.gate.ts`) is append-only shared traffic: every card that publishes a new symbol adds one export
line there, so the path is a shared meeting point, not contested work. When such a barrel is the ONLY
entry two file scopes share, the cards do not collide and must not serialize — measured on the live
board, one parked review card head-blocked five unrelated cards for hours over a single shared barrel
line (`overlapBlockedBy=RUFU-204`).

The exemption is deliberately narrow and per matched pair, never whole-scope or project-wide, and
requires no settings change: both raw entries must name the same concrete canonical barrel, and neither
side may be a directory/glob pattern (`packages/core/*` vs a barrel still serializes). A genuine
non-barrel collision in the same scopes keeps serializing — the exemption is evaluated per pair, so
scope-wide waivers (`isCoordinationOnlyTask`) and project-wide `overlapIgnorePaths` stay untouched.
Breadth is the risk here: this suppresses a safety mechanism, so a bare `src/index.ts`,
`repo-a/src/index.ts`, `packages/core/src/routes/index.ts`, or `index.tsx`/`index.d.ts` never matches.
A workspace repo-key prefix (`<repoKey>/packages/<pkg>/src/index.ts`) is recognized because
`normalizeOverlapScopeForTask` qualifies scope entries before comparison.

The review-lane lease lifetime is intentionally unchanged: a review-lane holder keeps its lease while
its checkout is unmerged, and pausing must not release it; only the pairwise path comparison waives the
barrel entry. Both matcher copies (engine `findFileScopeOverlaps` and core `repairScopesOverlap`) call
`isSharedBarrelOnlyMatch` so scheduler admission, the dispatch gate, gridlock detection, self-healing,
the overlap report, and store repair cannot drift.
