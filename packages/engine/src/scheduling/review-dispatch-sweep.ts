Before this sweep, review work began ONLY inside a reviewer agent's own heartbeat procedure, so
the start latency of every review was that agent's patrol interval (6 h for the live reviewer) —
and a card moved into review between patrols waited hours, or never, if no patrol ever saw it.
Eligibility here is derived from committed state each tick (lane + paused + ledger + live run),
never from process memory, so a restart re-derives the same decisions. The ledger row opened
before dispatch is the idempotency key: `task_reviewer_runs_live_unique` makes a second
concurrent attempt a no-op.

it is the pool of enabled reviewers, because a reviewer runs one session at a time (`startRun` fails the active

  logs `[ReviewDispatchSweep] excluded-paused: SANE-509 (attempts=1) — no reviewer work dispatched`
  (same for SANE-510/512/513). Nothing can produce the missing verdict, so nothing reaches the merge
  door, so the park is re-confirmed forever — 1 lifecycle move in 40 minutes across the whole project.
  A park the engine authored is not an operator stop, the invariant `1da1e59381` already encodes for
