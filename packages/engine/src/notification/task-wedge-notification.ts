  `AUTO_MERGE_RETRY_REJECTED: Cannot merge <id>: task has enabled pre-merge workflow steps that never

  (measured on RUFU-225: the RUFU-180 sweep selected the card and the service answered `unavailable`).

  The key deliberately equals `describeTaskWedgeFromStallReason`'s stall key: the same card is
  described by the stall arm once the repair lane clears its failed status, and one episode identity
  across that transition is what keeps storm control intact — the per-reason cooldown cannot dedupe

FNXC:TaskWedgeNotifications 2026-09-25-17:48 (RUFU-273):
Operator next-step copy for every stall code, spelled as an exhaustive table over the WHOLE
`TaskStallReasonCode` union with `null` meaning "this code never alerts". The table used to be
`Record<Exclude<TaskStallReasonCode, "dependency-blocker">, string>`, which made "a new code was added
to the union" a silent non-event: the compiler only complained if someone happened to index the table
with it. RUFU-273 adds seven planning-lane codes and every one of them is deliberately silent here, so
the union-wide table with an explicit `null` arm is what forces a future author to decide — adding a
code without stating whether it alerts is now a compile error, which is the strictest form of the
fail-closed rule this file already documented for unknown codes.

Why each planning code is `null`: the wedge alert is a mailbox message saying "a human must act on this
card now", and none of these meet that bar. The card already names its cause on its face and in the
detail banner (RUFU-273's surface rule: the face names the cause, the body never re-asks for a human).
The capacity throttle is engine-owned and self-clears the moment a slot frees; the premise hold is
already announced by the plan-review path that wrote the episode; the recovery backoff is a scheduled
engine wait; `recoverable-work` is reported by the FN-283 vanished-work notice; and `plan-no-admission`
is a residual with no operator action to name. Alerting here would double-announce a cause that already
has an owner, which is the exact defect the `dependency-blocker` exclusion was written for.
