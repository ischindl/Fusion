FNXC:ZeroCommitLandingProof 2026-09-25-11:48 (RUFU-274):
The one landing-proof door every finalization lane passes through.

RUFU-262 is the motivating loss: the branch was 0 commits ahead of `main` and its tip was an ancestor of
`main`, so every lane reasoning from revision walks concluded "nothing to merge"; the worktree still held
the work as uncommitted files, and the card reached `done` while the cleanup sweep was already refusing
to delete that tree as "modified". Independent writers could each have produced that outcome, so a guard
in any single lane is insufficient — six review-lane finalization doors plus the shared finalize
primitive call this instead of deciding on their own.

Rules this file owns:
  • The lane's own `mergeConfirmed` / no-op flag is the claim under test, never an input. Only recorded
    delivery evidence that git can corroborate counts as landing proof.
  • A refusal writes the durable hold marker that `getTaskMergeBlocker` reads, so the row states the
    hold on its face and every later door answers the same way until a human acts.
  • A refusal is a human WAIT, never a failure: no `status` is written, so nothing can render this as
    `merge-failed` or spend a retry budget on it.
  • Evidence, not content: path counts plus a capped path list are recorded; file contents never are.

FNXC:PreMergeGateResolution 2026-09-29-17:17 (RUFU-274, review finding ae5d844d):
The required-gate set that the zero-commit finalize guard demands comes from the canonical
`resolvePreMergeGateForTask` — the same classification the ordinary merge door already blocks with.
Its three per-lane predecessors returned `undefined` whenever the store's selection reader came back
empty, and an absent selection is this project's NORMAL shape (measured 2026-09-27: 0 of 91 cards
updated in the previous three days carried a `workflowId` or `workflowSelection`), so the guard's
`missingRequiredGate` arm could never fire while the guard claimed to check it. `RUFU-337` — enabled
`code-review`, zero result rows, finalized `done` — is that dead branch's live row shape; the identical
shape (`RUFU-225`) was refused at the merge door precisely because the door uses this resolver.
`resolvePreMergeGateForTask` keeps the carve-out honest: only `not-workflow-aware` (a store with no
selection reader at all — legacy embedders and test doubles) yields the empty set and retains the
historical result-only semantics, while `no-selection` computes the default workflow's default-on
gates (`builtin:coding` ships `code-review` default-on), and a `read-failed` classification gets those
same default gates rather than an empty set — the stricter direction the merge doors themselves take by
rejecting the write outright. Resolution itself never throws: a missing or corrupt definition degrades to
the built-in IR rather than raising.
