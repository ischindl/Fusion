FNXC:PostMergeRecovery 2026-10-01-09:01 (upstream FN-9442 adopted, RUFU-306 / RUFU-370 / RUFU-430 layered on top):
Two implementations of one recovery existed after the upstream sync — ours (`reseedUnrunPostMergeGate`,
RUFU-306) and upstream's `resumeMissingPostMergeGate` (FN-9442) — under one filename. Upstream's is now the
single mechanism, because it owns two guards ours did not have: a fresh durable checkout lease is live
ownership even with no in-process session, and the seed is fenced on `expectedWorkflowSelection` plus
`expectedTaskUpdatedAt` so a card whose selection moved keeps its park instead of being seeded from an
unrelated workflow. What our seam had and their version lacked is kept as extensions here rather than as a
second function:
  - a bounded per-(task, gate) attempt budget, because their version resumes again on every pass and a gate
    that dies the same way each time burns model budget forever;
  - a refusal REASON on every non-resumable arm, so "why was this card not resumed" is answerable from the
    caller's notice instead of collapsing into one opaque boolean;
  - the per-project evidence contract (RUFU-430), so a board with no CI reporter is never told to go produce
    CI evidence and a board that declares the demand is never exempted;
  - the workspace-card refusal, because seeding a post-merge reviewer onto a lane whose repos are already
    cleaned makes the reviewer re-acquire against a moved base and burn the rerun budget (the SANE-507 loop);
  - `paused` cards whose only hold is the engine's own in-review stall deadlock stay resumable (RUFU-391):
    the classifier exempts paused cards, so refusing them here could never lift.
*/
/*
FNXC:PostMergeRecovery 2026-10-05-09:31 (origin/main FN-9502 adopted on top of the fork's contract seam):
This sync brings in upstream's second FN-9442 follow-up, which retried the same file. Nothing upstream added
is dropped, and nothing the fork layered on is dropped either:
  - ADOPTED verbatim: `EXHAUSTED_PREFIX`, `hasLegacyRecoveryFailure`, `isRejectedGateRecheckDue` (the
    15/30/60-then-hourly revisit of rejected evidence), and the exported `isPostMergeGateRecoveryDue` that
    puts them together. Upstream's fenced clear of the legacy `Post-merge verification needs remediation`
    park is adopted too, fence and checkout-lease preconditions included, because that park was written by
    an older build in the field and nothing else lifts it.
  - KEPT: the one `(store, task, { source, contract })` seam with the named refusal taxonomy. It is not a
    cosmetic preference — every production caller in the merged tree hands a card projection plus the
    per-project contract (`auto-merge-finalization.ts`, four `self-healing.ts` sites), and the finalizer's
    operator notice reads `reason` through `isTerminalPostMergeReseedRefusal`. Upstream's
    `{outcome:"resumed"} | {outcome:"not-resumable"}` is strictly less informative than `outcome` + `reason`
    (`resumed` ≡ `outcome:"seeded"`, `not-resumable` ≡ `outcome:"not-seeded"` plus the reason that names the
    operator action), so mapping their arms onto ours loses no answer.
  - NOT re-added: upstream's `exhausted` arm and `hasExhaustedRechecks` helper. They exist only in the merge
    base; FN-9502 deleted both from `origin/main` and replaced the terminal exhaustion park with the legacy
    clear plus the hourly revisit. The ≥3-failed-attempts count survives there as the schedule's clamp.
  - The two arms this seam can take are each bounded by the mechanism its own requirement names: the MISSING
    arm by the fork's durable per-(task, gate) budget, the REJECTED-EVIDENCE arm by upstream's schedule. The
    budget counts only the missing arm's own log marker, so it cannot strand CI evidence that lands after
    the early retries — which is the failure upstream's comment forbids.

FNXC:PostMergeReseedBudget 2026-10-03-08:13 (RUFU-502 review, finding F2):
The durable budget read fails closed on purpose, but a thrown read must not cancel a recovery BATCH. Four
of the five callers awaited this seam bare: the two self-healing passes were guarded only by a try around
their whole for-loop whose catch logs and returns 0, so ONE card whose durable row throws (`TaskNotFoundError`
is the real missing-row shape that loop itself expects) cancelled every later card in the batch and reported
a result indistinguishable from "nothing to recover", with no card row and no run-audit.

The seam therefore never throws: an unreadable budget becomes the NAMED refusal `durable-read-unavailable`
and the pass moves on to the next card. The fail-closed decision is unchanged — no proof of the budget means
no seed — only its delivery is. This is also why the reason is not swallowed into a boolean: callers own
reporting it, and `isTerminalPostMergeReseedRefusal` plus the lane log lines are where an operator sees it.

FNXC:PostMergeReseedBudget 2026-10-03-07:12 (RUFU-502):
The budget counts from the DURABLE row, never from the `task` projection the caller handed us. An empty
log is a PROJECTION, not an absence: `listTasks({ slim: true })`, the modified-since prelude and search
all answer `log: []` for a card whose durable log still holds every marker, so the original
`Array.isArray(task.log) ? task.log : hydrate` arm was dead code — the array test passed, the store arm
never ran, and the counter read zero attempts forever. Measured provenance of the two lanes that feed
slim rows: `self-healing.ts:3827` (card from `stuckById`, built by `listTasks({ slim: true })`) and
`self-healing.ts:3968` (card straight from `listTasks({ slim: true })`). The three hydrated callers
(`auto-merge-finalization.ts:423`, `self-healing.ts:4256`, `self-healing.ts:17488`) already worked, which
is why the bound looked live from the finalize lane while the recovery lanes deferred without limit.
Same defect, same shape as RUFU-452's fix on the pre-merge counter.

A REJECTED read is fail-closed: the error propagates instead of being swallowed to zero attempts, so an
unreadable durable row seeds nothing — a lane whose whole failure mode is re-seeding on false evidence of
a fresh budget must not treat a flaky read as a fresh budget. A `null` row (fake/legacy store shape)
remains decision-neutral and counts zero, exactly like the pre-fix `?.log ?? []` arm; the real store's
missing-row shape is a `TaskNotFoundError` throw and takes the rejection path.

The bound is the retained window, stated rather than assumed: the activity log keeps only its most recent
1,000 entries (`logEntryImpl` splices the front on append), so a card churning past that after its
markers can earn one further re-seed. That is bounded degradation of a ceiling, not the unbounded loop
this read replaces. `store.getTask` is safe off-lock here: it takes the non-reentrant per-task advisory
lock and no stack that reaches this seam holds it — `withTaskLock` call sites are triage, agent-tools and
`moves.ts`, none of which call `resumeMissingPostMergeGate`.

  FNXC:PostMergeRecovery 2026-10-08-02:01 (RUFU-319): upstream's fence coverage around the seed, restored.
  The sync merge narrowed this seam's fence to the legacy-park clear alone, on the reasoning that the clear
  is the only TASK mutation. The reasoning holds for task rows and fails for the card's work: the idle
  continuation insert below is a durable write that starts a reviewer run, and `merge-write-fence.ts`'s own
  contract is that "abort is asynchronous, so ownership is read immediately before each individual mutation
  or irreversible action; a closure, loop, or function-entry check cannot cover a later write". The outer
  wrap in `auto-merge-finalization.ts` cannot substitute for it: that check runs BEFORE `resume()` is
  entered, and the abort that matters lands DURING the resume — between the work-item read and the insert —
  which is precisely the window origin's `fence.write("finalization", seed)` closed. Measured on the merged
  tree, an aborted lane still inserted the continuation and still wrote its log line, so a merge body that
  no longer owned the card could schedule work on it. The suppressed write is reported as the already
  existing transient `finalize-blocked` refusal: the lane lost ownership, a later pass owns the card.
