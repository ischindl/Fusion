/*
FNXC:LifecycleContainment 2026-10-07-15:22 (RUFU-308 Step 3):
The two refusal lines below are SIGHTING records — they state that a recovery pass asked this seam for
something it must refuse — not state records. RUFU-291 proved an unbounded sighting log is how a dead
card masquerades as "being worked on": `self-healing-stranded-recovery` asked for a backward move every
~45 s, the card never moved, and the History surface filled with byte-identical lines while nothing
owned re-entry. A refusal is therefore recorded once per (taskId, refusal kind, column, live-state
signature): an identical repeat returns silently, and only a state change (lane, status, step rows)
re-announces. The FIRST sighting of a signature stays unconditional — existing recovery tests assert the
durable line, and the operator must always see a refusal they have not yet seen.

The dedupe state is keyed by the store instance (WeakMap) rather than by a process-global map because
engine processes, and every test in a file, share one module instance: a global map would let one
card's signature suppress a different store's identical card, which is exactly the false silence an
operator cannot debug. Execution re-entry is owned by `executor/execution-rearm.ts` (same node, same
step, no lane change); this seam keeps only the refusal.

 * Exported because the graph-failure refusal in `executor/route-graph-failure-to-execution-resume.ts`
 * is the second sighting-record writer: RUFU-291's evidence-less disposal cycle re-logged its own
 * refusal line on every ~45 s pass, and a refusal line the operator has already seen is the noise this
