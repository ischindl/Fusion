/**
 * Hold/release sweep — the generalized scheduler (U6, KTD-10, R3 behavior half).
 *
 * Flag-ON, the scheduler's poll becomes a *hold/release sweep*: for each
 * workflow in use by live tasks, it finds cards resting at `hold`-trait columns
 * and evaluates their release condition:
 *
 *   - `manual`         — released ONLY by an explicit {@link promoteHeldTask}
 *                        call (U9's promote endpoint / CLI). The sweep never
 *                        auto-releases a manual hold.
 *   - `external-event` — released ONLY by {@link releaseHeldTaskByEvent} (a
 *                        webhook/API release, same shape as manual + an event
 *                        tag).
 *   - `timer`          — released when the injected clock passes the hold's
 *                        deadline (`columnMovedAt + durationMs`, or an explicit
 *                        `deadlineAt`). Fake-timer friendly (FN-5048): the clock
 *                        is injected, never `Date.now()` baked in.
 *   - `capacity`       — released when a downstream capacity (`wip`) column has a
 *                        free slot (same counting rules as the in-txn check).
 *   - `dependency`     — released when the card's dependencies are satisfied
 *                        (KTD-5: dependency task's column has the `complete`
 *                        trait flag in ITS resolved workflow; FN-5719 dual-accept
 *                        also honors the legacy completion signal, logging an
 *                        audit-diff when the two disagree).
 *
 * Eligible cards move via `store.moveTask(..., { moveSource: "scheduler" })`.
 * A scheduler move bypasses trait guards (it is substrate-driven) but the in-txn
 * capacity check is NOT a guard — it still runs (KTD-10), so two holds racing
 * into one slot serialize: exactly one commits, the other rejects with
 * `capacity-exhausted` and retries next sweep.
 *
 * Reservation ordering (KTD-10): for releases into a processing (capacity)
 * column, the sweep reserves worktree + semaphore slots BEFORE issuing the move
 * and releases the reservation if the move rejects on capacity — a card is never
 * moved into a column it cannot actually start in, and a semaphore-exhausted
 * interleaving leaves the card held with no commit.

    /*
    FNXC:ListTasksDeriveOptOut 2026-09-09-00:55 (RUFU-202):
    This full-board read is the engine's single most expensive one. Live it measured avg 10.6 s /
    max 159.8 s once per scheduler pass, with `prefetch` at ~100 % of the sweep and `evaluate` at
    0 ms, so it starved dispatch (`[backlog-pressure] todo=11 inProgress=0`), left 489 passes
    budget-truncated, and forced scheduler/continuation-drain/triage guard openings.

    A field-read audit over all 1118 lines of this file proves no consumer reads a derived UI signal:
    none of `inReviewStall`, `stalePausedReview`, `inReviewStalled`, `stalePausedTodo`, `ageStaleness`,
    `stalledReview`, `retrySummary`, `stallReason`, `reviewBypass`, `timedExecutionMs` appears here,
    while release decisions do read persisted fields (`column`, `status`, `paused`/`userPaused`/
    `pausedReason`, `nextRecoveryAt`, `columnMovedAt`, `dependencies`, `enabledWorkflowSteps`,
    `workflowStepResults`, `approvedPlanFingerprint`, `prompt`, `title`, `description`, timestamps).
    UI-signal derivation is therefore pure cost at this call site.

    The selection read this sweep still needs is not lost with the derivation feed: the batch fallback
    below resolves every id through `getTaskWorkflowSelectionsAsync(missingIds)` in one round trip, so
    `selectionReadTally` reports 0 from `listTasks` while `counters.batchSelections` counts that batch
    and the logged read tally stays truthful. All three accounting objects are still passed so a future
    caller that re-enables derivation gets the shared caches back.

    FNXC:WorkflowScheduling 2026-09-09-15:10 (origin/main sync):
    Upstream concurrently added `definitionReadTally` (its own comment above) to this same call. The two
    changes compose: upstream accounts for workflow-definition reads, while derivation and the log column
    stay switched off here. Do not drop either half — removing `derive: false`/`excludeLog: true` restores
    the 10.6 s avg board read; removing `definitionReadTally` loses upstream's read accounting.

    FNXC:ListTasksExcludeLog 2026-09-09-01:49 (RUFU-202):
    `excludeLog` is the second, bigger half: `log` is ~11 KB/row and this sweep never reads it, nor
    does any of the 14 `@fusion/core` helpers it calls with a task (`resolveColumnCapacity`,
    `isUnplannedSeedPrompt`, `isTaskBlockedOnApproval`, `isPlanReviewSatisfied`, ...) — none touches
    `task.log`, and the log-backed merge/heal readers that do exist (`hasAutoHealableVerification
    BufferFailure`) are reached from the merge lane, not from here.

    Two cheaper-looking variants are deliberately NOT used because each costs more than it saves:
    - `slim: true` also drops `log`, but it bundles the drop with `finalizeSlimListTask`, which
      re-parses PROMPT.md for every task whose persisted `steps` is empty via the unmemoised
      `parseStepsFromPromptImpl` — one `existsSync` + `readFile` per such task, per pass, on the
      sweep's hot path. It additionally blanks `prInfo`/`review`/`attachments` and can newly populate
      `steps`, and the sweep's own release decisions must not shift as a side effect of a bandwidth
      change. `excludeLog` buys the same byte saving with neither.
    - `excludeColumns: ["log"]` is not a column projection at all: it filters board LANES, and setting
      it also switches off `listTasksImpl`'s `excludeColumn: "archived"` narrowing, which would put
      archived cards back into a release-decision pass.
