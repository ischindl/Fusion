Every verdict carries `promptFingerprint` (sha256 of the authoritative prompt the verdict was
computed from) so the RUFU-246 refusal-episode signature can bind a refusal to the exact plan
revision: once replanning rewrites PROMPT.md, the fingerprint changes and the escalation count
resets. An unreadable prompt fingerprints as the empty string.

FNXC:PlanPremises 2026-09-27-02:40:
`premise-invalidated-by-delivery` is a NEW verdict, not a synonym for `stale`. Both mean "a stated
fact no longer holds", but only `stale` means "the plan was written against a repository that has
moved on". When the commits that falsified the facts are the card's OWN (see plan-premise-tree.ts),
replanning is the wrong remedy — the planner would re-derive the same facts from a tree its own
delivery changed — so this verdict must not enter the refusal ladder at all.

RUFU-246 lifts the violated premises out of the prose detail into a structured payload so the
rejection episode can hash exactly the fields that describe WHY the card was refused. Each entry
carries the violated premise JSON and a fixed human-readable reason naming what was found; the
premise's own `path` is its location. A verdict no longer stops reporting at the first violation:
the whole violated set is enumerated so a planner sees every fact that drifted. The shape is
deliberately unchanged by the commit-identity work — the culprit commit rides the prose detail, so
the episode signature of an existing refusal cannot shift under stored episodes.

    Round 1 made the identity ladder resolve the declared base inside a workspace MEMBER, because a
    workspace root is a container and not a git repository. A premise path is written from the project
    root, so `lager-manager/src/main/java/X.java` is the SAME file the member repo calls
    `src/main/java/X.java`. Reading the written path out of the member's tree would ask that repo for a
    path it has never had and would call a true fact false. The path is therefore re-rooted at the
    member the identity resolved in — and ONLY when its first segment is exactly that member, because
    guessing which sibling a bare path meant is how a premise stops being falsifiable. A single-repo
    card has no member prefix and takes the untouched path.

    The violation keeps the WRITTEN path and only the git read is re-rooted: the refusal-episode
    signature is hashed from the premise as the plan states it, and shifting it under a running card
    would silently reset an escalation count the operator is watching. Both paths are named in the
    reason, because an operator reading only the card must be able to tell whether the plan named the
    wrong file or the resolved-in-member file is what went missing.

    An unresolvable re-rooted path stays `stale`, deliberately and not `unavailable`. We DID measure
    it: `git ls-tree` answered definitively inside the right repository at the right commit, and the
    answer was "not there" — which is the same physical fact that has always produced `stale` for a
    single-repo card, so a card must not get a different kind for the same fact depending on how its
    project is laid out. `unavailable` is the shape reserved for "the engine could not look", and
    claiming that here is what would wedge the card: `hold-release` treats it as a retryable refusal
    with NO episode, NO escalation, and NO replan, so the card would be re-measured forever, produce
    the same definitive negative every time, and never be handed the one remedy that clears a wrong
    path — a replan. `stale` is self-clearing by construction: it rewrites PROMPT.md, the prompt
    fingerprint changes, and the refusal count resets. Only a planner that keeps writing the same
    missing path escalates on, and that refusal is the correct loud one.
