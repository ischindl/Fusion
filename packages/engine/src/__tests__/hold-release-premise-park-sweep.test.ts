FNXC:PlanPremises 2026-09-16-04:08:
RUFU-246 Step 4 — a terminally parked plan-premise card must be invisible to the scheduled hold
release sweep: the skip sits at the top of the candidate loop, BEFORE the per-task IR resolve, so a
parked card draws no IR definition read, no PROMPT.md read, no premise evaluation, no reservation,
no refusal log, and no audit row on later passes. The parked card selects its own workflow, so
`getWorkflowDefinition` call ids are per-workflow evidence: resolving only the control's workflow is
the direct proof the park skipped before IR resolution, and without the skip the park would also
surface as a held `manual-only` candidate. The control card — whose IR resolve proves the candidate
loop iterated — makes the assertions non-vacuous in every environment. (The shared-harness
sweep-release failures that predate this task make the control's MOVE environment-dependent, so no
release outcome is asserted.)
