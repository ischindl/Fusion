The operator symptom: two cards whose runs had already ended `failed` kept the project's
`active_tasks` guard refusing an isolation transition, because `InProcessRuntime.getMetrics()`
answered "how much work is running" with the raw size of the executor's *ownership* map.
These suites pin the replacement contract from both sides — the holder count is liveness-derived
(Step 1/2), and a landed terminal park never leaves its binding behind (Step 3) — plus the guard
behavior the operator reads (Step 4).

FNXC:WorktreeLiveness 2026-10-08-04:24 (RUFU-323):
Release invariant for the terminal parks. `handleGraphFailure` is one of only two places allowed to end
a worktree-ownership claim, and before this change NO terminal park released anything: the graph
`finally` releases only external-execution checkouts and `execute()`'s release is gated on
`task.paused`, so a failed card's entry survived forever and was counted as in-flight work.

Each case drives the real `handleGraphFailure` on a real `TaskExecutor` and asserts the binding on both
sides of the fence: a park that COMMITS releases, while a park that is declined, thrown, or preempted by
a honoring classifier preserves it. Releasing on a skipped park would delete the holder of a run that is
still using the checkout.

The operator symptom stated end to end, at the exact value the guard reads. SANE-435 and SANE-453 were
`status: "failed"` cards parked in the WIP lane while `ProjectManager.restartProjectRuntime()` refused
the isolation transition with `{ kind: "active_tasks", count }`, because that guard reads
`InProcessRuntime.getMetrics().inFlightTasks` and the metric answered with the size of the executor's
worktree-OWNERSHIP map. These cases wire a REAL runtime to a REAL executor and drive the REAL failure
sink, so neither half of the fix can be faked out: the release at the terminal park and the liveness
derivation both have to hold for the number to reach zero. The paired live case is what proves the
fix did not simply silence the guard.
