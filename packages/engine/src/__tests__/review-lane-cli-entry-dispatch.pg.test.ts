/*
FNXC:ReviewLaneDispatch 2026-09-09 (STAS-205 Step 6 — CLI entry path, proven on a real store):

`fn task move` never asks the daemon for anything. `packages/cli/src/commands/task.ts` resolves a
ProjectContext whose store boots through the PostgreSQL startup factory (`createLocalStore`) and
calls `store.moveTask(id, column, { moveSource: "user" })` — the CLI bundle LINKS core's
`moveTaskInternalImpl` and runs it in its own process against the shared database. Routing that call
over HTTP would be a cross-process refactor of a write that already lands in the right place, so the
decision is: keep the direct path, and make the *invariant* hold regardless of who wrote the column.

This file is that decision's artefact. It drives the CLI's literal call, then ONE sweep tick, and
asserts the two things the decision depends on:

1. ENTRY IS ATTRIBUTABLE FROM DATA. A human crossing into the review lane is recorded in
   `run_audit_events` with `metadata.callerStack` — the only frame-level record of who moved the
   card. `packages/cli/dist/bin.js` appears in that stack in production (Step 1 measured it live at
   12:06:20.317Z); here the driver's own frame is what must appear, which is the same mechanism.
   Lifecycle events name the `moveSource` but not the caller, so this row is what the requirement
   keys on.
2. THE ENTRY PATH CANNOT AFFECT DISPATCH. The sweep reads persisted state only — it never sees
   `moveSource`. A card parked in the review lane by a CLI-shaped move gets reviewer work from the
   first tick after its grace window, on a RENAMED board as well as the default one, while an
   otherwise-identical card in the WIP lane gets nothing.

LANE: `.pg.test.ts`, skipped via `pgDescribe` when no PostgreSQL is reachable, so the merge gate is
unaffected. Throwaway per-file database; never the embedded instance, never port 4040.
