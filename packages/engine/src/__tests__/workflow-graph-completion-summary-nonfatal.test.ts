/*
 * FNXC:WorkflowCompletion 2026-07-01-16:30:
 * Regression for issue #1863 (v0.52.0 triage loop). The built-in
 * completion-summary node is best-effort — a deterministic fallback backfills
 * task.summary — and every built-in workflow wires it with a success-only edge.
 * A thrown handler exception or a failed summary projection write bypasses the
 * advisory `!blocking → success` coercion and, absent a failure edge, terminates
 * the graph at 'completion-summary'; the in-review→todo resume router then bounces
 * the task back to execution forever. These tests assert the invariant across BOTH
 * failure modes: a failing completion-summary node never terminates or loops the
 * graph, while a non-summary node still fails normally.
