FNXC:ListTasksDeriveOptOut 2026-09-09-14:45 (RUFU-202):
This is the measurement RUFU-202 was specified around, not a regression test. The deploy evidence in
`docs/solutions/performance/list-tasks-derive-optout-and-memo.md` records the hold-release sweep at
avg 10.6 s / max 159.8 s from `tasks=4791` list reads, on passes that came back budget-truncated with
`unevaluated=489`. The acceptance gate for this change is measured, not inferred: the converted read
must be at least TWICE AS FAST as the read it replaces, and a board the sweep budget could not finish
must start finishing.

Two phases are measured, because they answer different questions:

* **read phase** — `store.listTasks()` alone, pre-change option set vs shipped option set. This is
  literally the thing RUFU-202 changed, so the 2x gate is applied here.
* **sweep phase** — whole `runHoldReleaseSweep()` passes over the same board, through the real store.
  Whole-sweep time is *not* the 2x gate: the sweep's per-candidate evaluation (capacity, unplanned
  gate, dependency reads) is identical under both read shapes, is most of a pass, and varies more than
  the difference under test. The sweep phase carries the end-to-end safety claims instead — decisions
  must not move on any pass, and the shipped median must beat the pre-change median.

The budget claim is therefore asserted on the read, where it is measurable: the slowest shipped read
must still cost less than a typical pre-change read. The production-budget pass stays in the report so
a host that does reproduce deploy-scale latency (raise `FUSION_HOLD_RELEASE_ROWS`) still exercises the
conditional gate on the real 10 s budget.

Measured on 2026-09-09 against a PostgreSQL 16 container at the deploy's 4,791 cards and ~11 KB log per
row (30 timed passes and 20 timed reads per shape): pre-change read avg 2121 ms / p50 2050 ms, RUFU-201
half (derive opt-out alone) 514 ms, shipped (`derive:false` + `excludeLog:true`) avg 252 ms / p95 271 ms
— an 8.4x read reduction against a gate that asks for 2x. Sweep medians moved 4795 ms → 2741 ms.

Green unit tests are not evidence here, and neither is a bench with a fake seed, so the harness asserts
its own preconditions before timing anything: expected row count, a `log` jsonb column averaging the
deploy's ~11 KB per row, and visible workflow selections. A bench that silently seeded empty logs
would "prove" a speedup that does not exist — an early draft of this file shipped exactly that bug as
a raw-SQL id formatting mistake, and the self-check below is what caught it.

Gated behind `FUSION_HOLD_RELEASE_BENCH=1` plus a reachable PostgreSQL: seeding ~4,800 wide rows and
sweeping them repeatedly is a measurement run, not something the merge gate should pay for. Run it:

  Whole-sweep wall time is gated on its MEDIAN only. Roughly two thirds of a sweep pass is per-candidate
  evaluation that both read shapes perform identically, and on this host its spread is wider than the
  difference under test (30 passes: A p50 4647ms / max 8298ms vs C p50 3030ms / max 10131ms). A
  p95-vs-p50 window over that noise fails on a change that is genuinely faster, so the portable budget
  claim is asserted where it is actually measurable: on the read itself. The slowest shipped read must
  still cost less than a typical pre-change read — that is the property that turned the deploy's
  budget-truncated passes into passes that finish, stated without depending on this container's
  evaluation noise.
