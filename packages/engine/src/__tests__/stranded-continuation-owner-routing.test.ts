FNXC:StrandedContinuationReclaim 2026-09-22-14:21 (RUFU-263):
The reclaim sweep used to answer every non-empty `blockedReason` with the same two writes — a forced
`runnable` transition plus a `[recovery]` card-history line — because the fallthrough in
`evaluateStrandedContinuationReclaim` never read the reason at all. On a `held` row that pair repeats every
~15-minute maintenance pass: the census this task required measured 5,914 of 7,038 retained recovery rows
(84%) in exactly that shape, and RUFU-220 accumulated 782 identical `[recovery]` lines while the card never
moved off `todo`.

`held` is not one condition, and the test below asserts the disposition each condition is owed:

  - A reason in the store's claimable-hold families (`workflow-principal-%`, `workflow-named-principal-%`,
    `workflow-role-pool-%`) is a wait the scheduler's own claim predicate can re-take. FN-8923 is the named
    recovery seam for the planning lane. Pure suppression: the sweep must write NOTHING, because deferring
    these rows would set `retryAfter`, and the claim path lists through the same due-gate.
  - An FN-514 human-merge hold (`workflow-human-merge-approval*`) is a wait `releaseHumanMergeApprovalHolds`
    releases — and that releaser also reads through the due-gated held listing, so suppression is again the
    only safe disposition.
  - A file-scope wait (`file-scope:<blockerId>`) is owned by `releaseFileScopeWaitingContinuations`, which
    lists work items for the task (not due-gated), so a suppression here is safe while the task still names
    the blocker; a reason naming a blocker the task no longer has is an orphan and a reclaim is real recovery.
  - `dependency:<taskId>` has no dedicated releaser, so it gets the sweep's bounded re-check: a durable
    `retryAfter` on the ladder while the task still depends on the named blocker.

Surface enumeration for the invariant: the classifier is asserted per reason family (principal × 3 shapes,
human-merge, file-scope live/stale, dependency live/stale, dependency-configuration-block, unknown, empty),
across the ladder's three widths, and at the caller for each of the four dispositions (none / defer / requeue
/ retire-free reclaim), including the restart case where only the durable row remains.

/* ── RUFU-285: convergence to the wait the task row proves ────────────────── */

/*
FNXC:StrandedContinuationReclaim 2026-09-26-02:40 (RUFU-285):
RUFU-263's dedup cannot reach a card whose re-holding writer replaces the row instead of CAS-ing it: the
process-local memo is keyed on `taskId|nodeId|state|blockedReason`, and the reason oscillates (NULL from the
capacity `onSuspend`, `plan-review-close-*` from the planning-close hold) while the re-queue itself nulls
`retryAfter`, erasing the durable width the ladder reads back. RUFU-254 measured 402 `[recovery]` lines in 6
days at a 72–85/day cadence for exactly that shape, with zero `-no-action` (defer) rows ever written.

The durable truth that survives all of that is on the **task** row: `overlapBlockedBy` names the card whose
file-scope lease is being waited for, published by `transitionQueuedEpisode`. When the holder is live, that
pair proves the wait is real, so the sweep **converges** the row to the reason the shipped releaser matches
(`file-scope:<holderId>`) and stamps the ladder in the same write — no re-queue, no `[recovery]` line, no
planner wake. The block below pins that contract and, just as loudly, the shapes that must keep re-queuing.

/* ── Owner hand-off: what suppression must never break ─────────────────────── */

/*
FNXC:StrandedContinuationReclaim 2026-09-22-16:03 (RUFU-263):
Every `action: "none"` the classifier returns is a promise that SOMEONE ELSE will still act on the row, so
each suppression is answered here by driving the real owner over the very same row:

  - `file-scope:<blockerId>`                → `releaseFileScopeWaitingContinuations` (event-driven, per-task listing)
  - `workflow-human-merge-approval*`        → `releaseHumanMergeApprovalHolds` (due-gated `held` listing)
  - `workflow-principal-*` (planning lane)  → `reconcilePrincipalHeldPlanningContinuations` (FN-8923), which
    restores the `needs-replan` signal triage discovers on; off the planning lane the same family is re-taken
    by the store's own claim predicate, pinned by the family-agreement guard below and by
    `workflow-work-item-cas.pg.test.ts` against the real index.

The load-bearing assertion in each case is `retryAfter === null` after the suppressed pass. The drain and
`releaseHumanMergeApprovalHolds` both list through `listDueWorkflowWorkItems`, which filters `retryAfter <=
now`: a deferral stamped here would hide the row from the only seam allowed to release it, converting
RUFU-263's audit churn into a permanent freeze. The last two cases bound the other direction — an owner that
REFUSES must not leave the row stranded either.

Symptom-verification suite for the RUFU-254 loop. The staged card is the real shape: `todo`/`queued` with
`blockedBy: null`, `overlapBlockedBy` naming a live card, and the matching `queuedLogEpisodeSignature`,
against a `held` `plan-review` row that carries no owned reason. `handoffHarness` is the CAS-faithful fake —
it applies the patch, honours `expectedState`/`expectedLeaseOwner`, and due-gates the listing exactly like
