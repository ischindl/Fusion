/*
FNXC:ForkExtensionsDoc 2026-10-05-01:25:
docs/fork-extensions.md is the single record of which capabilities belong to this build rather than
to upstream Runfusion/Fusion, and README links it from the hero section. Upstream's own migration
`0085_drop_excluded_upstream_feature_schema.sql` names this build as the full-featured one and lists
the slots it never implements (0074, 0076, 0079-0083), so the boundary is upstream-authored, not a
claim we invented. A README claim that outlives its code is worse than no claim, so this guard
asserts the observable facts behind the table: each capability's anchor file still exists and still
carries the identifier the table cites, upstream's relocation migration never appears here (we are
the build it moves features *out of*), and our own schema slots stay present. Deleting a capability
without updating the doc now fails CI.

Deliberate scope limit: nothing here asserts documentation prose, headings, or date stamps — only
link integrity and code constructs. The doc's "deliberately not claimed" list cannot be guarded from
this repository because it makes a statement about `origin/main`, which a test run does not fetch.
