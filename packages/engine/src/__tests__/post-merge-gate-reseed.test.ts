/*
FNXC:UnrunPostMergeGateRecovery 2026-09-25-15:35 (RUFU-306):
A merge-confirmed card can sit in `in-review` forever because the enabled gate-mode post-merge group
never reported: the merge ran on the `merge-attempt` success edge, finalization refused, the run
ended, and nothing put the card back in front of the node. Measured on the production board
2026-09-25 as `Auto-merge finalization deferred for DGXS-313 / ROZV-290 … 'post-merge-verification'
has not reported`, with RUFU-220 and ROZV-286 parked the same way while their commits sat on `main`.

This lane must repair that WITHOUT three failure modes, and each has its own test below:
- it may not fabricate evidence — only a `missing` gate is seeded; an existing row carrying a real
  negative verdict is a review decision and re-running it would be a machine overruling a gate;
- it may not move the card — lifecycle containment (FN-207/FN-217) means the seeded continuation
  names the column the card actually stands in;
- it may not loop — finalize retries constantly, so the durable per-(task, gate) budget is what
  stops a gate that dies identically from burning model budget until the operator arrives.
