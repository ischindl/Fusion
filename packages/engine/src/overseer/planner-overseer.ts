    Keyed on the ROLE, because keyed on the id this returned null for every card on a renamed board.

    The blast radius is why this is worth the parameter rather than a fallback: `observeTask` returns
    early on a null stage, so no observation is recorded, no `overseer:intervention` entry is emitted,
    and `PlannerRecoveryController` — which consumes those observations — has nothing to steer, retry
    or targeted-fix. The entire oversight loop went inert and said nothing about it, the same shape as
    the self-healing sweeps whose queries returned empty arrays.

    THE FLAGS ARRIVE AS A PARAMETER because this function is pure and sync with no store and no task
    id to resolve from. The cost objection I recorded when first auditing this — "resolving inside
    `observeTask` buys a workflow read per card per poll" — turned out to be answered by the caller:
    `project-engine.ts`'s poll ALREADY awaits `resolveEffectiveSettings` per task, so it is a per-task
    async loop already, and an IR cache keyed by workflow makes the addition (distinct workflows)
    resolutions rather than (cards).

    THE REVIEW TEST IS THE THREE-TRAIT UNION, not `isReviewColumnRole`, which checks only
    `mergeBlocker || humanReview`. A board whose review lane carries `merge` (mergeOrchestration) —
    the default's own shape — would otherwise be classified as not-in-review and skipped, which is the
    bug this change is removing, arriving through the helper meant to fix it.

FNXC:WorkflowReviewGates 2026-07-26-16:50:
Gate-anchored stall detection for the in-review stages. Neither the `reviewer` nor the `merger`
branch had ANY time-based check — both fell through to `progressing` unconditionally. That was
tolerable while the pre-merge gates ran in `in-progress` (the FN-7743 executor check covered them),
but Code Review / Browser Verification now run with the card in `in-review`, so a hung gate that
never posts a verdict produced no stall signal at all, however long it hung.

Applied to BOTH in-review stages deliberately: `resolveWatchedStage` maps a plain in-review card
with no `reviewState` to `merger`, not `reviewer`, so a task running its first gate usually lands
in the merger branch. The pending pre-merge lease is the authoritative "a gate is running" fact
regardless of which sub-stage was inferred.

Anchored on the gate's own `startedAt`, never `columnMovedAt`: the latter conflates "entered
review" with "gate started" and would fire during a legitimate human merge-wait — the false
positive that would make the signal untrustworthy. Only engages while a pre-merge result is
actually `pending`; a card whose gates have settled and is awaiting a human merge stays
`progressing`.

Reuses the resolved `executorStuckAfterMs` threshold — this is a hung agent session, the same
failure the executor check covers, so it needs no second setting. The reason is bucketed to whole
hours so the FN-7577 `stage|signal|reason` feed dedup stays effective (it must never embed a
changing millisecond value). A missing/malformed timestamp degrades to no signal; never fabricate a
stall. The FN-7514 human-control guard still runs upstream, so `autoMerge:false` rows stay
human-owned regardless of what this returns.

RUFU-308: the executor-stage inactivity verdict must be measured from the card's LAST EXECUTION
EVIDENCE, not from the moment it entered the WIP lane. `columnMovedAt ?? updatedAt` — the FN-7743
proxy — prefers the column-entry clock whenever it exists, so a card that kept completing steps
after entry was still declared inactive: measured on RUFU-291 (main tip `5b7cdd962b`) the overseer
emitted "Executor stage inactive for over 3h / … / over 9h with no execution activity" every hour
while its Step 3 and Step 4 completed at 04:43 and 05:17. Measured again on RUFU-308 itself on
2026-10-07: the first steering injection landed at 17:34, three hours after column entry, while
the card's own step bookkeeping had been written less than an hour earlier — the claim is false in
both directions (silent during a real stall, loud during real progress).
`updateTask` bumps `updatedAt` unconditionally for every writer (AGENTS.md, RUFU-350), and
`TaskStep` carries no per-step timestamps, so the freshest durable proof that the executing lane
touched this card is the row clock itself plus the newest workflow-step-result lease/completion.
Taking the maximum costs nothing in sharpness: a genuinely stalled card writes nothing, so its
row clock stays as cold as its column entry and the verdict fires on exactly the same schedule it
always did. It is deliberately NOT the base for the dead-session probe above — that probe answers
"is anything running this card?", which no amount of recent row-writing can answer yes to.

      (`over 3h … over 9h with no execution activity` broadcast hourly while Steps 3 and 4 finished)
