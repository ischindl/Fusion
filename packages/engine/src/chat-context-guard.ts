/**
 * Deterministic pre-overflow compaction gate for the chat/CLI pi-session path.
 *
 * FNXC:ChatContextGuard 2026-08-18-18:06:
 * RUFU-118 phase 1: pi's built-in threshold auto-compaction is blind when no assistant
 * message carries non-zero provider usage (its estimateContextTokens reports
 * lastUsageIndex: null and _checkCompaction returns "No usage data at all"). Providers
 * that omit usage in the stream (observed: dsai1/deepseek-v4 openai-completions) keep
 * every assistant message at all-zero usage, so long chats silently grow past 96% of the
 * window and degrade to 1-token replies with no compaction. This gate re-measures the
 * loaded context at every chat send seam and forces compaction before the prompt when
 * the estimate crosses the threshold. It is a backstop on the chat/CLI lane only — the
 * executor lane keeps its existing TokenCapDetector (undefined = disabled) semantics.
 *
 * FNXC:ChatContextGuard 2026-08-18-18:06:
 * Threshold semantics: threshold = min(tokenCap ?? round(0.8 * contextWindow),
 * contextWindow - max(16384, maxTokens)). On the chat lane tokenCap is an UPPER BOUND on
 * the effective threshold, not an exact target: unset falls back to 80% of the per-model
 * context window, and values above the hard limit (contextWindow - reserve) are clamped.
 * The 0.8 default belongs here (engine pure function), not in the settings schema, so
 * the schema default stays undefined.
 *
 * FNXC:ChatContextGuard 2026-08-18-18:06:
 * Fail-loud contract: the gate never sends a call it cannot prove fits. When the loaded
 * context is at or above the threshold it compacts via the existing compactSessionContext
 * (session.compact()), re-measures, and throws ChatContextOverflowError when compaction
 * is unavailable/returns no result, when it throws, or when the post-compaction estimate
 * is still at or above the hard limit. Non-pi session shapes (plugin CLI runtimes without
 * getContextUsage), unknown context windows, and unknown token counts skip the gate with a
 * diagnostic warn instead of throwing — provider overflow errors from those sends still
 * surface through the existing chat failure paths.

  Escalation tier 3 (RUFU-183): the LLM-free fallback. Tiers 1-2 both depend on a summarizer
  round-trip, so saneca chat-b6a74d40 refused with the context at 221% of its hard limit — pi said
  "Already compacted" while a 110,034-token message list was still loaded, because pi compares
  message-only tokens against a 20 000-token keep-recent budget and never subtracts the static
  prompt/tool floor it must still send. A deterministic partial branch rewrite cannot fix that
  measurement (only pi owns it) but it CAN guarantee the outcome: the floor is constant, so cutting
  the message list to `compactionTarget - floor` provably lands the rebuilt context under target.

  Route A, mirroring pi's own compact() tail exactly — public `appendCompaction`, then
  `buildSessionContext()`, then the live-view assignment — so there is no private-pi back door and
  the durable transcript is re-read rather than assumed. pi's in-memory refresh is a direct
  `agent.state.messages =` write with no event or handler, so Route A installs the rebuilt list the
  same way; no pi event is replayed. Supersession is carried by the public `firstKeptEntryId`, which
  is why a `newSession` branch is not needed and not used.

  It runs AT MOST ONCE per send, never on a healthy send, never for `nothing-to-compact` (which is
  "too small", not "too big") and never when the outcome was produced. An attempt reports four
  outcomes (RUFU-183 review): `rescued` proves the reduction; `floor-dominated` means the static
  floor alone leaves no message budget, so the refusal re-attributes to `static-floor` — blaming
  pi's refusal there sends triage to retry compaction instead of trimming the tool set; a
  `truncated-unproven` attempt keeps the arm's reason but carries the truncation evidence, because
  Route A cannot un-append a durable compaction; `incapable` leaves the refusal arms byte-identical
  to RUFU-182 — a tier that cannot prove convergence is not allowed to trade the honest refusal
