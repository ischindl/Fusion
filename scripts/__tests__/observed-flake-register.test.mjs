RUFU-197. The register is append-only history, so records accumulate in two document orders — some write
`Status` above `File`, some below — and an earlier parser that required `File` then `Exact test` on adjacent
lines silently skipped every record that deviated. Parsing is now per heading, so a record is read wherever its
lines sit. `status` stays null when a record has none: an undispositioned record is treated as live.

FNXC:MergeRebuild0919 2026-09-19-21:45:
Canonical rewrote the sibling reader to scope the `File`/`Exact test` scan to the `## Active observation records`
sections, so an archived record may keep citing a deleted ratchet file. This line solves the same problem per record
instead of per section: `evaluateRegisterRecords` below exempts `Closed`-status records from the exists/drift check and
requires an evidence pointer, while still drift-checking a closed record whose file survived. Two readers cannot
share one name with different return shapes, and the merged body has no call site for canonical's variant, so this
parser is the single entry reader; canonical's archived-path concern stays covered by the closed-record branch.

FNXC:TestFlakeRegister 2026-08-19-12:04:
FN-9146 requires the register's active statuses to name the current evidence owner after a completed campaign. Enforce the stated count, retained observation state, ownership, and inbound testing-guide anchors so that decision surface cannot silently drift.

FNXC:TestFlakeRegister 2026-08-30-04:25:
A closed record may stay PHYSICALLY inside the active section when later evidence still cross-references it: entry 7 was closed on 2026-08-23 after its file was quarantined, but the FN-9146 campaign-evidence assertion below reads its per-run table in place, so relocating it to the archive would destroy that coverage. The stated introduction count describes ACTIVE records only, so closed-status entries are excluded here rather than moved. Counting raw sections instead made the two disagree the moment entry 7 closed and left main red. Drift protection is unchanged: the pinned list below still fixes every active heading and its exact status text.

FNXC:TestFlakeRegister 2026-09-03-23:58:
RUFU-181 added active record 15 (the notification-service whole-file OOM first sighting), so the pinned list gains its fifth element. The list is order-sensitive and mirrors document order, so a new active record must be appended last in the same commit that adds it — the count assertion alone would not catch a heading or status-text edit, which is exactly why the deepEqual exists.
*/
/*
FNXC:TestFlakeRegister 2026-09-03-22:23:
The register now records that evidence owner FN-9146 was archived on 2026-09-03 without a named
successor, so active records 1 and 2 are unowned pending their next sighting. The pinned status
texts below track that archived-owner annotation; do not strip it without re-homing the records.

FNXC:TestFlakeRegister 2026-09-09-13:51:
FN-9283 closed entry 14 by deleting stale FN-6735 coverage that asserted FN-217-removed automatic
review-to-WIP recovery. The active inventory must exclude the archived record, so a future quarantine
is never mistaken for an unresolved deletion-ratchet obligation.

FNXC:WorkflowResultsTabMocks 2026-09-20-09:58:
FN-9336 closed entry 15 after request-aware selector fixtures proved the whole file and its exact
preserved-column reproduction green. The record stays physically in the active section for first-sighting
evidence, while this active inventory must include only entries 2 and 13.

FNXC:TestFlakeRegister 2026-09-10-19:28:
Entry 14 closed 2026-09-09 when the deletion ratchet executed via commit 55912bd665, which
removed the test file, the quarantine ledger entry, and the engine-reliability exclude in one
commit. The register record now keeps its historical identity on relabeled File/Exact-test
lines that no longer match the dangling-path scan (the file no longer exists to drift-check),
and identifies the required successor without making the archived path active.

FNXC:TestFlakeRegister 2026-09-13-10:38:
FN-9297 replaces the ghost FN-9287 hand-off and delivers deterministic FN-6735 unit coverage in
merge-pause-abort-recovery.test.ts. The archived entry remains outside active-record validation,
while its successor reference makes the deletion-ratchet closure auditable.

FNXC:TestFlakeRegister 2026-09-12-04:32:
Entry 1 closed 2026-09-12: FN-9131's structural harness connection-budget fix (ae507afc37,
merged 2026-08-16) resolved its reproduced project-identity timeout with loaded re-measurement
green, and no sighting has occurred since. The status line now starts with "Closed", so the
active list drops to entries 2 and 13 and the stated count drops to 2. Entry 1's record and
its FN-9146 campaign table stay physically in the active section (readActiveRecordSections
does not filter by status), so the campaign-evidence assertion below still reads entry 1 in
place — keep it in expectedSubjectResults exactly like the closed-in-place entry 7.

FNXC:TestFlakeRegister 2026-09-24-19:55:
FN-9389 adds entry 17 after a one-time Full Suite terminal graph-gate mismatch. Its source and
outbox trace establishes no product race, so pin the active inventory and require its next
sighting to follow the file-level quarantine policy without weakening the durable contract.

FNXC:TestFlakeRegister 2026-09-29-07:58:
FN-9419 records a second sighting of entry 17, so the deletion ratchet moves it from the active
first-sighting inventory to the archive. Preserve both run identifiers, the exact test identity,
and the quarantined status as behavioral evidence without weakening the outbox assertion.

FNXC:TestFlakeRegister 2026-09-24-22:49:
FN-9390 records the triage retry warning as a high-value first sighting after source tracing
showed a fake-timer observation race rather than a production retry defect. Keep its active
status pinned so a repeat executes the file-level quarantine rule without weakening the warning.

FNXC:SkillsGetFlakeRegister 2026-09-29-14:00:
FN-9423 records one built CLI completion timeout only after the real built-entry file test passed.
The active inventory and evidence check keep the second-sighting quarantine decision tied to the
exact global-flag child lifecycle without widening its existing test budget.

storm, and the suite is now network-dead behind a connect-tripwire guard. A `Closed`-prefixed status
