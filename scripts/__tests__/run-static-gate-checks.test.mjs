FNXC:TestInfrastructure 2026-08-16-10:52:
FN-8991, FN-8994, and FN-9096 added runtime-skill-loader-drift,
workspace-package-graph, and cli-runtime-routing validators to the production
chains. Those chains are authoritative; retain their exact order here so this
mirror reports future declaration drift rather than preserving a stale list.

FNXC:TestInfrastructure 2026-08-25-12:13:
Commit 12c292ea6b added the 16th validator, check-no-comment-assertions-in-tests,
to the production gate:static chain without updating this mirror. RUFU-148
restores lockstep at the live position (between no-test-timeout-appeasement and
changeset-format); the chain in package.json remains the source of truth.

FNXC:SkillCatalogGenerationOwnership 2026-09-22-14:51:
RUFU-265 appends the 17th validator, check-fusion-skill-sync, at the end of the
chain so the contiguous validator prefix is preserved. It is the enforcement
point for the generated skill catalog: builds no longer regenerate those tracked
docs, so drift in the committed file must fail the blocking gate instead of
being silently rewritten by CI's earlier build step.

FNXC:LockfileDriftGate 2026-09-22-19:20:
RUFU-266 adds the 18th validator, check-lockfile-importers, beside
check-workspace-package-graph — both answer "does the workspace's declared
dependency graph actually match what is committed?", one against the workspace
globs and one against pnpm-lock.yaml. It belongs in the blocking chain because a
drifted committed lockfile is not discoverable from a task worktree: the dependency
auto-heal silently repairs it locally, and the resulting out-of-scope diff fails
unrelated cards' squash merges.

FNXC:RetentionCensus 2026-09-23-10:20 (RUFU-257):
RUFU-257 appends the 19th validator, check-retention-coverage, at the end of the chain. A dashboard
killed by its own heap looks like an infrastructure failure and costs hours of forensics, which is how
RUFU-249's death was finally explained; the census only prevents a recurrence while the ratchet that
forces every new module-scope cache to declare its bound stays in the BLOCKING chain. It runs there
rather than as an extra Lint step because `pnpm test:gate` already invokes every `check-*.mjs` in this
list through `run-static-gate-checks.mjs`, and Gate is one of the four required checks.

refactor that dropped the validator, so membership in the blocking prefix is pinned on its own. This is
the check that keeps a future chain reshuffle from quietly downgrading the retention ratchet to a
non-blocking step, which is the failure mode that let seven heap deaths accumulate before RUFU-249 was
explained.
