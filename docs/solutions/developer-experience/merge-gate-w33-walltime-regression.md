# Merge-gate W33 wall-time regression: controlled re-measure

## Problem

The W33 velocity row captured at `2026-08-16T06:01:44.671Z` reported `pnpm test:gate` at **14.0s**, versus **11.0s** in the preceding row. Boot smoke improved by 6.3s and changed-only improved by 116ms, so the one gate sample warranted investigation. The gate's composition documentation was also stale: it claimed 22 engine-core files and 12/14 validators while the actual gate had 21 files and 15 validators.

## Controlled measurement

FN-9122 used a built task worktree on Darwin 25.1.0 arm64 (28 CPUs, 256 GiB RAM), Node v26.3.0, and pnpm 10.33.0. Process checks found no concurrent Vitest, build, boot-smoke, or `fn serve` process. A priming run was discarded, then samples were serialized.

| Run | Pre-sample load (1/5/15m) | Gate wall time |
|---|---|---:|
| Warm 1 | 7.76 / 6.89 / 6.07 | 9.5s |
| Warm 2 | 7.75 / 6.92 / 6.10 | 9.3s |
| Warm 3 | 8.27 / 7.07 / 6.16 | 9.9s |
| Cold (removed transform cache and core gate bundle) | 8.59 / 7.20 / 6.22 | 10.9s |
| Post-ledger warm 1 | 5.32 / 5.81 / 5.90 | 10.1s |
| Post-ledger warm 2 | 7.19 / 6.21 / 6.04 | 9.5s |
| Post-ledger warm 3 | 7.53 / 6.33 / 6.08 | 9.0s |

The initial warm min/median/max was **9.3s / 9.5s / 9.9s**; the post-repair warm min/median/max was **9.0s / 9.5s / 10.1s**. Both medians are below 11.0s. W33 is therefore a **single-sample measurement anomaly**, not a reproduced gate regression.

## Coverage-parity baseline

The gate actually runs 15 static validators, 21 explicit engine-core files containing **432 tests**, two PG canaries, four unit-gate files, and CI-shape after successful concurrent lanes. `project-engine.test.ts` was removed from engine-core by FN-8937 (`0fbeba50d1`), so this is one fewer engine-core file than the W32 baseline. The policy contract now pins the 15-validator ordered inventory and its cardinality, and the corresponding static-runner and verify-fast test inventories match it.

**Counts and the pinning claim above are dated measurements of 2026-08-16, superseded in kind by RUFU-197.** The membership they describe drifted on schedule (the 2026-09-06 deletion ratchet retired one engine-core file), and `scripts/__tests__/engine-vitest-gate-policy.test.mjs` no longer freezes an inventory or its cardinality — it derives membership from `test:gate:static`, `packages/engine/vitest.config.ts`, `packages/core/package.json`, the quarantine ledger, and the filesystem. Read the file counts here as W33 telemetry; read the contract from those declarations.

## Attribution

| Phase | Warm timing |
|---|---:|
| Static validator fan-out | 2.0s |
| Engine-core | 5.3s |
| PG gate | 3.5s |
| Unit gate | 5.5s |
| CI-shape | 0.7s |
| Direct core gate-bundle rebuild | 0.2s |

The concurrent test critical path was the unchanged unit-gate lane, not engine-core or PostgreSQL. The gate bundle had 411 metafile inputs and was 4,188,513 bytes; its rebuild did not explain a three-second change. Individual static checks showed `check-inert-sync-lane-conversions` at 1.7s, `check-capacity-pool-id` at 1.4s, and `check-no-getdatabase` at 1.3s; the newly admitted `check-cli-runtime-routing.mjs` (FN-9096, `1d3f6c198c`) took 0.1s and remained inside the 2.0s concurrent fan-out.

The PG harness rewrite (`0935e27902`) was not the critical lane. The historical gate-safe barrel mirrors were also not implicated: engine-core remained 5.1–5.3s and the builder itself took 0.2s.

## Decision

Do not change a runtime gate seam on a single weekly measurement. For a future merge-gate spike:

1. Run a passing `pnpm build` preflight in the task worktree.
2. Record host facts, relevant-process absence, and pre-sample load.
3. Discard one priming run, then collect at least three serialized warm `pnpm test:gate` samples.
4. Treat the regression as reproduced only when the warm median exceeds **11.0s**.
5. Measure static, engine-core, PG, unit, and CI-shape lanes before changing code. Preserve 15/21/2/4/CI-shape coverage parity and never buy time by weakening signal.

## Precedents

- **FN-7666** (`845fad2aa4`) established that organic full-barrel growth can inflate every engine-core fork; the gate-safe barrel remains the evidence-backed protection.
- **FN-7667** retained the exclusion policy without narrowing to hand-picked symbols; this investigation kept that policy because the barrel was not the W33 seam.
- **FN-7669** supplied the rebuild-every-run core bundle; **FN-7670** and **FN-7673** closed the engine relative-import bundling lever after no benefit and a measured regression.
- **FN-8497** (`9002fca9de`) kept only high-value PG canaries and made test lanes concurrent; **`c15c78fee`** created the PostgreSQL gate lane that was explicitly measured here.
- **FN-8783/FN-8789** established the warm-cache healthy band and transform-cache policy used for comparison.
- **FN-8937** (`0fbeba50d1`) removed, rather than admitted, an engine-core file in the measurement window; **FN-9096** (`1d3f6c198c`) added the inexpensive static validator.

## FN-9144 confirmation (2026-08-18)

FN-9144 repeated the protocol on HEAD `86950400c9` after a passing `pnpm build`. No unrelated Vitest, build, boot-smoke, or `fn serve` process was present; pre-sample load was 6.49/5.07/4.35 and the cold sample load was 7.01/5.57/4.59.

| Sample | Cache state | Gate wall time |
|---|---|---:|
| Warm 1 | warm | 9.0s |
| Warm 2 | warm | 8.9s |
| Warm 3 | warm | 9.0s |
| Cold | transform cache and core bundle removed | 9.7s |

The warm median was **9.0s**, below the 11.0s healthy-band ceiling and the reported 13.0s regression bar. Attribution remained static 2.0s, engine-core 5.2s, PG 3.5s, unit-gate 5.5s, CI-shape 0.8s, and direct core-bundle rebuild 0.18s. The bundle had 411 inputs and 4,189,685 bytes. Unit-gate remained the concurrent critical path, matching FN-9122, so no runtime gate seam changed.

FN-9144 also added the generated velocity report's history-wide measurement-note channel and annotated the W33 capture with this confirmed variance verdict. The note persists in `scripts/test-velocity-history.json` and is rendered from all annotated entries, rather than disappearing when future cycles are appended.
