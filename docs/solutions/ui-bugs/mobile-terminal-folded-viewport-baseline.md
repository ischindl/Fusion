# Mobile terminal folded viewport baseline

## Problem

The terminal has two mobile xterm surfaces: the PTY `TerminalModal` and the embedded `SessionTerminal`. Both depend on visualViewport-derived keyboard metrics before fitting xterm rows/cols. On iOS-style browsers, `innerHeight` can shrink with the keyboard, so the code keeps a baseline viewport height captured while the keyboard is closed.

A foldable device can first expose an unfolded/wide closed baseline, then settle to a narrower folded baseline before the keyboard opens. If the folded closed sample is shorter than the previous baseline and the baseline only ever grows, the later keyboard-open sample overestimates the overlap. Conversely, a fold/orientation width sample can arrive after xterm's helper textarea is focused and the soft keyboard is already open; if that focused sample replaces the baseline, the keyboard-open height looks closed and clears the terminal CSS variables. A recurrence also appears when the terminal first renders after the helper/input is already focused and the soft keyboard is open: there is no prior closed visualViewport sample, so using the shrunken visualViewport as the baseline clears the overlap until a later unfold/orientation event supplies a usable layout. Android Chrome can also keep a tablet-sized layout viewport while `visualViewport.width` is the actual folded phone pane; if mobile detection only reads `innerWidth`/media queries, the terminal opens in desktop docked/floating geometry and xterm fits before the mobile shell is applied. These stale or missing geometries make the terminal fit against the wrong box and can surface as premature wrapping or spaced ASCII such as `p n p m  b u i l d`.

## Solution

Treat a keyboard-closed width/posture change as a new baseline, not as keyboard overlap.

- Track the viewport width alongside the baseline height.
- Preserve the max-observed baseline behavior for same-posture recovery from keyboard-open first samples.
- When width changes and the viewport height is a settled folded value, replace the baseline before computing iOS fallback overlap.
- Gate that replacement to keyboard-closed samples; if a keyboard-focusable element is active, keep the previous baseline so a focused keyboard-open folded sample cannot zero out the overlap.
- When the first sample is already focused and keyboard-open, prefer the layout viewport height (`documentElement.clientHeight` when available) over the shrunken visualViewport height so overlap and `--vv-height` are meaningful before any unfold repair.
- Treat touch-primary `visualViewport.width` as a mobile breakpoint input for both TerminalModal and shared viewport-mode consumers so folded Android panes render mobile controls and fullscreen sizing even when the layout viewport remains wide.
- Keep xterm's measured font family symbols-free; the fix is viewport measurement, not a letter-spacing or cell-width workaround.

## Regression coverage

Guard the invariant at three seams:

- `TerminalModal.test.tsx` simulates initial folded keyboard-open startup with ASCII (`pnpm build`) and prompt glyph output, duplicate visualViewport/orientation events, and asserts `--keyboard-overlap` / `--vv-height` plus xterm resize happen before any unfold. It also simulates unfolded closed → folded closed → folded keyboard-open and covers a focused folded keyboard-open sample so posture re-baselining cannot clear those CSS variables.
- `SessionTerminal.mobile.test.tsx` proves the embedded mobile input bar uses layout/folded metrics for both initial focused keyboard-open startup and folded-baseline replacement, while keeping the xterm measured font stack symbols-free. It also covers the Android folded case where media queries are desktop/tablet but touch `visualViewport.width` is phone-sized.
- `useMobileKeyboard.test.ts` covers the shared hook so future consumers inherit the posture-aware baseline behavior.
- `useViewportMode.test.ts` covers touch visualViewport width as a mobile-mode input for foldables whose layout viewport remains wide.

Existing terminal tests continue to cover symbols-free xterm font stacks, glyph fallback for Nerd Font/powerline output, duplicate visualViewport resize coalescing, keyboard close clearing, undefined visualViewport, tab-switch scrollback replay, and desktop/tablet terminal modes.
